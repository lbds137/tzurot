# Phase 4: Simple DDD Cutover (Solo Developer Edition)

## Reality Check âœ…

For a solo Discord bot project, we don't need enterprise-grade monitoring and 8-week rollout plans. Here's the realistic approach:

## Simple 3-Step Plan

### Step 1: Deploy with DDD Disabled (1 day)
```bash
# Deploy Phase 3 to production
git push # or however you deploy
# All DDD flags are false by default - legacy system still handles everything
# Test that nothing broke
```

### Step 2: Enable DDD Commands Gradually (1 week)
```bash
# Day 1: Enable utility commands (safe stuff)
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_ENABLED=true
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_INTEGRATION=true
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_UTILITY=true
# Restart bot, test ping/status/help commands

# Day 3: Enable everything else
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_AUTHENTICATION=true
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_CONVERSATION=true
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_PERSONALITY=true
# Test some personality operations

# If anything breaks: set the flag to false and restart
```

### Step 3: Remove Legacy Code (whenever)
```bash
# Once you're confident everything works:
# Delete src/commands/handlers/ directory
# Clean up legacy routing code
# Or just leave it there forever - it's not hurting anyone
```

## Emergency Rollback
```bash
# If DDD system has issues:
export FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_ENABLED=false
# Restart bot - back to legacy system
```

## "Monitoring" (Solo Edition)
- Watch Discord for error messages
- Check bot logs if something seems off
- Maybe test a few commands manually after enabling flags
- That's it!

## Success Criteria
- Bot doesn't crash âœ…
- Commands still work âœ…  
- No angry users âœ…
- You don't lose personality data âœ…
