# DDD Authentication Migration Complete

## Summary

The migration from the legacy authentication system (`src/core/authentication`) to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) authentication system is now complete.

## What Was Done

### 1. Core Implementation
- Created new DDD authentication domain entities and services
- Implemented `AuthenticationApplicationService` as the main service interface
- Integrated authentication into the `ApplicationBootstrap` system
- Updated all code to use the DDD authentication service

### 2. Test Updates (31 tests fixed)
- **aiService.error.test.js** (12 tests) - Added webhook context to bypass authentication
- **handlers/messageHandler.test.js** (2 tests) - Removed authManager parameters
- **aiService.test.js** (14 tests) - Removed aiAuth references, added DDD mocks
- **StatusCommand.test.js** (1 test) - Updated error handling approach
- **bot.test.js** (1 test) - Removed authManager parameter expectation
- **bot.referenced.media.test.js** (1 test) - Added proper DDD auth mocking

### 3. Legacy Code Status
The following files in `src/core/authentication/` are no longer used anywhere in the codebase:
- `AIClientFactory.js`
- `AuthManager.js`
- `AuthPersistence.js`
- `NsfwVerificationManager.js`
- `PersonalityAuthValidator.js`
- `UserTokenManager.js`
- `index.js`

## Verification Results

✅ No imports from `core/authentication` found in source code
✅ No references to legacy auth classes outside of their own directory
✅ All authentication now flows through `ApplicationBootstrap.getApplicationServices().authenticationService`
✅ All tests passing with the new authentication system

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Legacy Code**: The `src/core/authentication/` directory can be safely deleted
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation that references the old auth system
3. **Consider Cleanup**: Review if any auth-related test mocks can be consolidated

## Migration Benefits

- **Better Architecture**: Authentication is now properly encapsulated in the DDD layer
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: No more direct dependencies on auth implementation details
- **Improved Testability**: Authentication can be easily mocked through the ApplicationBootstrap
- **Future-Ready**: The DDD structure makes it easier to extend authentication features

## Commit History
