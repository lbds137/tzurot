| Help system | Basic | Rich embeds | 🟢 Enhanced |

### 8. Other Commands

All other commands (deactivate, reset, verify, help, ping, status, debug) have equivalent or enhanced functionality in DDD with no missing features.

## Summary Statistics

### Feature Comparison Totals

- **🟢 Enhanced in DDD**: 18 features
- **✅ Equivalent**: 35 features  
- **🟡 Different approach**: 6 features
- **🔴 Missing in DDD**: 5 features

### Critical Missing Features

1. **Avatar preloading** - Performance optimization
2. **Duplicate request protection** - Data integrity
3. **Alias collision handling** - User experience
4. **User ID tracking in activation** - Audit trail
5. **Message tracking integration** - Deduplication

### Risk Assessment by Command

| Command | Risk Level | Reason |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Add | **HIGH** | Missing duplicate protection, avatar preloading |
| Remove | **LOW** | Minor cache differences |
| List | **NONE** | Enhanced functionality |
| Activate | **MEDIUM** | Missing user tracking |
| Alias | **LOW** | Better validation offsets lookup difference |
| Others | **NONE** | All enhanced or equivalent |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Before Migration)

1. Implement duplicate request protection in Add command
2. Add avatar preloading for performance
3. Implement alias collision handling with suggestions
4. Add user ID tracking to activation

### Nice to Have (Can Be Post-Migration)

1. Auto display name aliasing
2. Profile info enrichment after creation
3. Direct alias lookups (architectural decision)

### No Action Needed

- Different approaches that don't impact functionality
- Enhanced features that improve user experience
- Architectural improvements in DDD system

## Testing Focus Areas

Based on this analysis, testing should focus heavily on:

1. **Add Command**: Edge cases, duplicates, performance
2. **Activation Tracking**: Audit trail verification
3. **Cache Behavior**: Ensure no stale data
4. **Error Scenarios**: All failure paths
5. **Permission Checks**: Security validation

## Conclusion

The DDD command system is largely superior to the legacy system, with better user experience, error handling, and maintainability. However, the five critical missing features must be implemented before the legacy system can be safely removed to ensure no regression in functionality or performance.
