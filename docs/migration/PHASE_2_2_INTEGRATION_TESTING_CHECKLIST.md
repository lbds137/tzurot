# Phase 2.2: Integration Testing Checklist

## Overview

This checklist guides the integration testing of all DDD commands in the development environment where feature flags are enabled.

**Environment**: Railway Development (develop branch)  
**Feature Flags**: All DDD flags enabled  
**Date Started**: 2025-01-21  

## Testing Guidelines

For each command, test:
1. **Basic functionality** - Does it work as expected?
2. **Error handling** - Does it handle invalid inputs gracefully?
3. **Feature parity** - Does it match legacy behavior?
4. **New features** - Do the Phase 1 additions work correctly?
5. **Performance** - Is response time acceptable?
