# Phase 2.2: Integration Testing Checklist

## Overview

This checklist guides the integration testing of all DDD commands in the development environment where feature flags are enabled.

**Environment**: Railway Development (develop branch)  
**Feature Flags**: All DDD flags enabled  
**Date Started**: 2025-01-21  

## Testing Guidelines

For each command, test:
1. **Basic functionality** - Does it work as expected?
2. **Error handling** - Does it handle invalid inputs gracefully?
3. **Feature parity** - Does it match legacy behavior?
4. **New features** - Do the Phase 1 additions work correctly?
5. **Performance** - Is response time acceptable?

**Issues Found**: 9 (All Fixed)  
**Performance Issues**: 0  
**Feature Gaps**: 0  

### Issues Log

1. **Ping Command (Fixed)** - Was showing 0ms latency instead of actual Discord websocket ping

   - Fix: Changed to use `client.ws.ping` for actual latency
   - Commit: `1d1f65e`

2. **Add Command (Fixed)** - Hardcoded bot prefixes in help messages and instructions

   - Commit: `f886b1e`

3. **Alias Resolution (Fixed)** - `&lilith` resolving to wrong personality
   - Root cause: Display names checked before global alias mappings
   - Fix: Implemented proper resolution order in FilePersonalityRepository.findByNameOrAlias
   - Commit: [session continued]

4. **Add Command (Fixed)** - Misleading tagging options showing display name first

### Notes

- Automatic display name aliasing creates intuitive shortcuts (e.g., lilith-sheda for second Lilith)
- Automatic alias syncing between global and per-personality systems prevents data inconsistency
- Avatar preloading and thumbnail display significantly improve user experience
- Dynamic prefix and mention character support works correctly across all tested commands

## Sign-off

- [ ] All commands tested successfully
- [ ] No critical issues found
