## V2 Testing Architecture

```

### Key Patterns from V2

#### 1. Consolidated Mock System
V2 created a unified mock system to avoid duplication:

```javascript
// V2 Pattern: Mock Presets
const { presets } = require('../../__mocks__');

beforeEach(() => {
  mockEnv = presets.commandTest({
    userPermissions: ['ADMINISTRATOR'],
    discord: { nsfw: false }
  });
});
```

#### 2. Global Mock Setup
```javascript
// V2: tests/setup.js
jest.mock('../src/application/bootstrap/ApplicationBootstrap', () => ({
  ApplicationBootstrap: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    initialize: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  })),
}));
```

#### 3. Strict Timer Enforcement
V2 had strict ESLint rules and scripts to enforce injectable timers:
- `scripts/check-timer-patterns.js`
- Pre-commit hooks
- No real timers allowed in tests

#### 4. Performance Requirements
- Test suite must run in < 30 seconds
- Individual test files < 5 seconds
- Always use fake timers

---

## What Worked Well

### ✅ 1. Consolidated Mock System

**Benefit:** Avoided duplication across 100+ test files
**Evidence:** V2 had a clear, reusable mock API

```javascript
// Good: Single source of truth
const mockEnv = presets.commandTest();
const message = mockEnv.discord.createMessage();
```

**Lesson for V3:** Create reusable mock factories, not presets.

### ✅ 2. Strict Timer Discipline

**Benefit:** Prevented slow, flaky tests
**Evidence:** V2's test suite ran in ~14 seconds for hundreds of tests

**Lesson for V3:** Use Vitest's built-in fake timers, enforce via config.

### ✅ 3. Test-Driven Anti-Patterns Detection

**Benefit:** Caught common mistakes automatically
**Evidence:** Pre-commit hooks + CI/CD checks

Scripts that enforced quality:
- `check-timer-patterns.js` - No real timers
- `check-test-mock-patterns.js` - Proper mock usage
- `check-singleton-exports.js` - No singletons

**Lesson for V3:** Create similar Vitest-compatible checks.

### ✅ 4. Behavior Testing Philosophy

**Benefit:** Tests focused on "what" not "how"
**Evidence:** V2 documentation emphasized testing behavior over implementation

From V2's CLAUDE.md:
> "Always test BEHAVIOR, not IMPLEMENTATION. If you're testing private methods, mock internals, or exact call counts, you're doing it wrong."

**Lesson for V3:** Maintain this philosophy, document it clearly.

---

## What Didn't Work

### ❌ 1. Mock Presets Were Too Magic

**Problem:** Developers didn't understand what was being mocked

```javascript
// V2: What does this actually mock?
const mockEnv = presets.commandTest();
// Magic! Discord, API, modules all set up... but how?
```

**Impact:**
- Tests became "black boxes"
- Hard to debug when mocks didn't behave as expected
- Tight coupling to preset implementation

**V3 Solution:** Explicit mock factories where developers see what's mocked.

### ❌ 2. Too Much Manual Mocking

**Problem:** Some tests had 80+ lines of mock setup

Example from V2's `validateAvatarUrl.test.js`:
```javascript
// 80 lines of jest.mock() calls!
jest.mock('node-fetch', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/logger', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/utils/errorTracker', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/utils/urlValidator', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/utils/avatarManager', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/webhook', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/utils/webhookCache', () => { /* ... */ });
jest.mock('../../src/utils/messageDeduplication', () => { /* ... */ });
```

**Impact:**
- Test setup dwarfed actual test code
- Brittle tests (change one import, break many tests)
- Cognitive overload for developers

**V3 Solution:** Dependency injection + focused mock factories.

### ❌ 3. Loss of Type Safety

**Problem:** V2 used `as any` to bypass TypeScript errors in mocks

```javascript
// V2 Pattern that caused production bugs
const mockClient = {
  getAllReleases: jest.fn(), // Method doesn't actually exist!
} as any;
```

**Impact:** The `getAllReleases` bug - a method was mocked that didn't exist on the real object, causing production failures.

**V3 Solution:** Type-safe mocks that enforce interface compliance.

### ❌ 4. Separated Test Directory Structure

**Problem:** V2 had tests in a separate `tests/` directory

```
src/handlers/messageHandler.js
tests/unit/handlers/messageHandler.test.js  # Far from source
```

**Impact:**
- Hard to find relevant tests
- Parallel directory structures became out of sync
- Developers forgot to create/update tests

**V3 Solution:** Co-locate tests next to source code.

### ❌ 5. DDD Migration Created Test Complexity

**Problem:** V2's DDD migration created circular dependencies and complex bootstrap mocking

From V2's CLAUDE.md:
> "⚠️ The Service Locator Anti-Pattern: NEVER import ApplicationBootstrap in modules that it might import"

**Impact:**
- Global mocks to break circular dependencies
- Complex test setup just to avoid import cycles
- Tests coupled to DDD architecture

**V3 Solution:** Simpler architecture, no DDD over-engineering.

## V3 Testing Architecture

### Test Structure
```
services/bot-client/
├── src/
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── personalityMentionParser.ts
│   │   └── personalityMentionParser.test.ts  # Co-located!
│   └── test/
│       ├── setup.ts                          # Service setup
│       └── mocks/
│           ├── PersonalityService.mock.ts    # Type-safe factories
│           ├── UserService.mock.ts
│           └── Discord.mock.ts
├── vitest.config.ts                          # Service config
└── package.json
```

### Core Patterns

#### 1. Type-Safe Mock Factories

```typescript
// V3: Explicit, type-safe factory
export function createMockPersonalityService(
  personalities: MockPersonality[]
): PersonalityService {
  const personalityMap = new Map(
    personalities.map((p) => [p.name.toLowerCase(), p])
  );

  const mockService: PersonalityService = {
    loadPersonality: vi.fn().mockImplementation(async (name: string) => {
      const personality = personalityMap.get(name.toLowerCase());
      return personality ? mockPersonalityObject(personality) : null;
    }),
    getAllPersonalities: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(personalities as Personality[]),
  };

  return mockService; // No `as any`!
}
```

**Key Difference:** TypeScript enforces that all methods exist!

#### 2. Dependency Injection

```typescript
// V3: Function accepts dependencies
export async function findPersonalityMention(
  content: string,
  mentionChar: string,
  personalityService: PersonalityService  // Injected!
): Promise<PersonalityMentionResult | null>
```

**Benefit:** No global state, easy to test, explicit dependencies.

#### 3. Built-in Fake Timers

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
fakeTimers: {
  toFake: ['setTimeout', 'clearTimeout', 'setInterval', 'clearInterval', 'Date'],
}
```

**Benefit:** No custom timer injection needed, works automatically.

## Key Improvements

### 1. TypeScript Type Safety

**V2 Problem:** Mocks used `as any`, lost type checking
**V3 Solution:** Properly typed mocks

```typescript
// ❌ V2 Style - Compiler can't help
const mock = { method: jest.fn() } as any;

// ✅ V3 Style - Compiler enforces interface
const mock: MyService = {
  method: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(result),
};
```

**Impact:** Compiler catches mock/interface mismatches at build time.

### 2. Co-located Tests

**V2 Problem:** Tests separated in `tests/` directory
**V3 Solution:** Tests next to source

```
personalityMentionParser.ts
personalityMentionParser.test.ts  # Right there!
```

**Impact:**
- Easier to find tests
- More likely to update tests when code changes
- Clear which modules have test coverage

### 3. Explicit Over Magic

**V2 Problem:** Preset-based mocks were opaque
**V3 Solution:** Explicit factories

```typescript
// V3: You see exactly what's mocked
beforeEach(() => {
  mockPersonalityService = createMockPersonalityService([
    { name: 'Lilith', displayName: 'Lilith', systemPrompt: '...' },
  ]);
});
```

**Impact:** Easier to debug, understand, and maintain.

### 4. Simpler Architecture

**V2 Problem:** DDD created test complexity
**V3 Solution:** Simple classes, constructor injection

```typescript
// V3: Just pass dependencies
class MessageHandler {
  constructor(
    private personalityService: PersonalityService,
    private userService: UserService
  ) {}
}
```

**Impact:** No bootstrap mocking, no circular dependency workarounds.

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Mock Architecture

**V2 Approach:** Presets (`presets.commandTest()`)
**V3 Approach:** Factories (`createMockPersonalityService()`)

**Rationale (from Gemini):**
> "Your V3 factory pattern is superior. It is more maintainable and scalable. Presets can become a 'black box' where developers don't understand the underlying setup."

**Implementation:** Create focused factory functions for each service.

### Decision 2: Dependency Injection

**V2 Approach:** Required constructor injection for ALL dependencies
**V3 Approach:** Constructor for classes, method parameters for functions

**Rationale (from Gemini):**
> "V2's strict enforcement was likely too rigid. Use constructor injection for your long-lived service classes and method injection for utility functions."

**Implementation:** Be pragmatic, not dogmatic.

### Decision 3: Test Organization

**V2 Approach:** Dedicated `tests/` directory
**V3 Approach:** Co-located (`.test.ts` next to source)

**Rationale (from Gemini):**
> "Placing tests next to source files is an excellent, modern practice. High visibility, easy to find and update tests when changing source code."

**Implementation:** `src/**/*.{test,spec}.ts` pattern.

### Decision 4: Fake Timers

**V2 Approach:** Custom injectable timers + ESLint enforcement
**V3 Approach:** Vitest's built-in fake timers

**Rationale (from Gemini):**
> "Absolutely stick with Vitest's built-in fake timers. They are robust, easy to use, and the industry standard. The overhead of an injectable timer service is not worth the benefit."

**Implementation:** Enable in config, use `vi.advanceTimersByTime()`.

### Decision 5: Coverage Strategy

**V2 Approach:** Mostly unit tests (testing pyramid)
**V3 Approach:** Integration-focused (testing trophy)

**Rationale (from Gemini):**
> "For microservices, a traditional 'testing pyramid' is often replaced by a 'testing honeycomb' or 'testing trophy' model, which emphasizes integration tests. Your balance should be heavily weighted towards **integration tests**."

**Implementation:**
1. Unit tests for complex business logic (parsers, algorithms)
2. **Integration tests for service interactions** (most tests here)
3. Contract tests for inter-service communication (future)
4. E2E tests for critical user journeys (minimal)

## Lessons Applied

### From V2's Successes

1. ✅ **Consolidated Mocks:** V3 has mock factories in `src/test/mocks/`
2. ✅ **Timer Discipline:** V3 uses fake timers by default
3. ✅ **Behavior Testing:** V3 docs emphasize testing behavior
4. ✅ **Performance Targets:** V3 aims for fast test execution

### From V2's Failures

1. ✅ **No More Magic:** V3 uses explicit factories, not presets
2. ✅ **Type Safety:** V3 enforces proper mock types
3. ✅ **Co-location:** V3 tests live next to source
4. ✅ **Simpler Architecture:** V3 avoids DDD complexity

### New in V3

1. ✅ **TypeScript:** Full type safety in tests
2. ✅ **Vitest:** Modern, faster test runner
3. ✅ **Microservices Testing:** Integration-focused strategy
4. ✅ **Clear Separation:** Each service has own test config

## Summary

**V2 taught us:**
- Mocking discipline is critical
- Timer control prevents flaky tests
- Testing behavior > implementation
- BUT: Magic abstractions harm maintainability
- BUT: Separate test directories reduce visibility
- BUT: `as any` defeats TypeScript's benefits

**V3 improves by:**
- Type-safe mocks with compiler enforcement
- Explicit mock factories (no magic)
- Co-located tests for visibility
- Simpler architecture (no DDD over-engineering)
- Modern tooling (Vitest, TypeScript)
- Integration-focused test strategy

**Result:** A testing infrastructure that's faster to write, easier to maintain, and catches more bugs at compile time.
