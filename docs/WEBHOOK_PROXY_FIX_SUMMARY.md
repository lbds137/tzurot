# Webhook Proxy Fixes Summary

## Problem Description

1. **Age Verification Issue**: PluralKit webhook users were receiving "Age Verification Required" messages even though they should have been allowed to use the bot without verification.

2. **Auth Command Issue**: Webhook users were getting errors when trying to use auth commands because the system didn't properly handle webhook authentication.

These issues were occurring because:

1. The webhook detection logic in `webhookUserTracker.js` was not robust enough to identify all PluralKit webhook messages.
2. The `shouldBypassNsfwVerification` function wasn't handling command messages from webhook users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Proxy Detection & Authentication

We improved the webhook proxy detection logic in `webhookUserTracker.js`:

- Added known webhook proxy application IDs (like PluralKit's bot ID)
- Added detection of proxy system patterns in message embeds and content
- Implemented a caching system to remember webhook IDs that have been identified as proxy systems
- Added more robust pattern matching for PluralKit-specific patterns (like pk: prefix)

### 2. Improved NSFW Verification Bypass

We enhanced the `shouldBypassNsfwVerification` function to:

- More reliably detect proxy system webhooks with the improved detection logic
- Automatically bypass verification for any webhook message that starts with the bot's command prefix
- Include proper error handling for null author usernames

### 3. Testing and Documentation

- Created a comprehensive test script (`scripts/test_webhook_proxies.js`) to verify the new detection logic
- Updated documentation in `WEBHOOK_PROXY_HANDLING.md` with details about the enhanced detection

## Code Changes

### webhookUserTracker.js

Added:
- Known proxy webhook IDs list
- Cache for identified proxy webhooks
- Enhanced detection logic that checks:
  - Application ID
  - Webhook username
  - Embed fields
  - Message content
  - Command prefix
- New `isAuthenticationAllowed` function to specifically handle auth commands

Modified:
- `isProxySystemWebhook` function to use all the detection methods
- `shouldBypassNsfwVerification` to handle command messages from webhooks
- Special handling for auth commands in shouldBypassNsfwVerification

### commands.js

Modified:
- Updated `processCommand` to use webhookUserTracker for authentication checks
- Added special handling for webhook users in auth command
- Added security restrictions for auth commands from proxy systems
- Implemented proper user ID resolution for webhook messages
- Added bypasses for help command for webhook users

## Testing Results

All test cases passed in our test script:
- PluralKit detection by application ID
- PluralKit detection by username
- PluralKit detection by system ID in embeds
- PluralKit detection by pk: prefix in content
- Normal webhook handling
- Command detection from webhooks
- Auth command handling for proxy systems (rejected for security)
- Help command handling for proxy systems (allowed)

## Future Considerations

1. Consider exposing a webhook whitelist configuration that server admins can customize
2. Explore direct API integration with PluralKit to get the actual user behind a proxy
3. Implement a more sophisticated way to associate real users with webhook proxies
4. Add a way for proxy system users to link their accounts with their regular Discord accounts
5. Consider a more secure authentication flow specifically designed for proxy system users
6. Monitor for any changes in how proxy systems format their messages that might break detection
