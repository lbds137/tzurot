# DDD Disaster Analysis

This directory contains the analysis of the failed DDD implementation after 107 commits and weeks of work.

## Files

- `ddd_commits.txt` - List of all 107 commits between main and develop
- `ddd_analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of what went wrong
- `changed_source_files.txt` - List of 107 changed source files

## Summary

The DDD implementation fundamentally misunderstood the domain:
- Built PersonalityProfile with prompt/modelPath (wrong)
- Didn't fetch displayName/avatarUrl/errorMessage from API (critical miss)
- Over-engineered with event sourcing, value objects, etc.
- 172 new files, 55k+ lines of code that doesn't work

## Current Status

- `main` branch: Safe, has working legacy system
- `develop` branch: Broken DDD system with legacy removed
- Cannot merge to main because core functionality is missing

## Next Steps

TBD after Gemini consultation with longer timeout.
