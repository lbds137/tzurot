# DDD Migration Documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Context: Read This First!

The DDD migration is **~25% complete**. We have a hybrid system where commands and authentication use DDD, but core bot functionality remains legacy. This is the reality, not a transition state.

## Current State (July 2025)

### ‚úÖ What's Actually Migrated
- **All Commands** (18 total) - 100% DDD with clean architecture
- **Authentication Domain** - Fully integrated into message flow
- **Domain Infrastructure** - Events, repositories, application services

### ‚ùå What's NOT Migrated  
- **AI Service** - Completely legacy (`aiService.js`)
- **Message Processing** - Legacy handlers (`personalityHandler.js`, `bot.js`)
- **Conversation Management** - Legacy (`conversationManager.js`)
- **Webhook System** - Legacy (`webhookManager.js`)

### üìä By The Numbers
- ~25% of codebase uses DDD patterns
- ~75% remains legacy
- 0 feature flags controlling the split (it's hardcoded)

## üó∫Ô∏è Documentation Map

### Start Here
1. **[MIGRATION_STATUS_REALITY.md](MIGRATION_STATUS_REALITY.md)** - Honest assessment of where we are
2. **[AI_SERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](AI_SERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)** - Next recommended migration (if continuing)
3. **[CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_GAP_ANALYSIS.md](CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)** - Why Conversation domain isn't ready

### Architecture Documentation
- **[Current Hybrid Architecture](#)** - How the two systems coexist
- **[Domain Boundaries](#)** - Where DDD ends and legacy begins
- **[Integration Points](#)** - How DDD services integrate with legacy

### Migration Guides
- **[AI Service Migration](AI_SERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)** - 3-week plan to migrate AI service
- **[Conversation Domain](CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_DETAILED_ANALYSIS.md)** - 4-week plan (not recommended yet)
- **[Singleton Pattern Migration](SINGLETON_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - How to avoid circular dependencies

### Reference Documentation
- **[DDD Deployment Guide](DDD_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Production deployment considerations
- **[DDD Enablement Guide](DDD_ENABLEMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Working with the hybrid system

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated/Aspirational
- **[DDD Implementation Summary](DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Contains inaccurate completion claims
- **[POST_DDD_ROADMAP.md](POST_DDD_ROADMAP.md)** - Assumes full migration (hasn't happened)

## üéØ Quick Decision Guide

### Should I Continue the Migration?

**Option 1: Complete the Migration**
- Start with [AI Service Migration](AI_SERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) (3 weeks)
- Then [Message Processing](#) (4-6 weeks)
- Finally [Conversation Domain](CONVERSATION_DOMAIN_DETAILED_ANALYSIS.md) (4 weeks)
- Total: 3-4 months

**Option 2: Optimize the Hybrid**
- Accept the current state as permanent
- Improve integration points
- Document the hybrid patterns
- Focus on new features

**Option 3: Gradual Opportunistic Migration**
- Migrate components when touching them for features
- No dedicated migration effort
- Could take years

## üö¶ Navigation by Use Case

### "I need to add a new command"
‚Üí Use DDD patterns in `src/application/commands/`

### "I need to modify AI request handling"
‚Üí Work in legacy `src/aiService.js` (not migrated)

### "I need to change conversation tracking"  
‚Üí Work in legacy `src/core/conversation/` (not migrated)

### "I need to update authentication"
‚Üí Use DDD `AuthenticationApplicationService` ‚úÖ

### "I need to understand the architecture"
‚Üí Read [MIGRATION_STATUS_REALITY.md](MIGRATION_STATUS_REALITY.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconceptions

1. **"The migration is almost done"** - No, it's 25% done
2. **"Feature flags control DDD usage"** - No, the split is hardcoded
3. **"Conversation domain is ready"** - No, it needs 4 weeks of work
4. **"Everything uses DDD patterns"** - No, only commands and auth

## üìù Documentation Standards

When updating docs:
- Start with reality, not aspirations
- Date your updates
- Mark sections as `[OUTDATED]` rather than deleting
- Link to this README as source of truth

## üîÑ Last Updated

**July 2025** - Comprehensive audit and reality check

**Remember**: This is a hybrid system. New commands use DDD, core bot logic uses legacy patterns. Both are production code that needs to be maintained.
