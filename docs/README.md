## üìù About This Project

Tzurot (Hebrew for "shapes") is a personal project I created to explore Discord bot development and AI integration. It started as a way to bring AI personalities into Discord after a certain service discontinued their official integration.

The bot has grown to include:
- Multiple personality management
- Webhook-based authentic messaging
- Media handling (images and audio)
- User authentication system
- Comprehensive test suite
- And much more!
