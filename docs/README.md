## Documentation Guidelines

### Where to Put New Docs

| Doc Type | Location | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Design decision | `architecture/` | System architecture, data models |
| Deployment procedure | `deployment/` | Railway setup, environment config |
| Developer guide | `guides/` | Local setup, debugging, testing |
| Migration procedure | `migration/` | Data migrations, imports |
| Project planning | `planning/` | Roadmaps, feature tracking |
| Feature spec | `features/` | Detailed feature documentation |
| Improvement proposal | `improvements/` | Not-yet-implemented enhancements |
| Operational procedure | `operations/` | Backups, monitoring, incidents |
| Reference doc | `reference/` | CLI references, API docs |
| Template | `templates/` | Reusable document templates |
| One-time/completed | `archive/` | Historical records |

### Naming Conventions

- Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` for major documents
- Use `lowercase-with-dashes.md` for specific topics
- Be descriptive: `memory-and-context-redesign.md` not `memory.md`
- Avoid dates in names (use git history instead)

### Cross-References

When linking to other docs:
```markdown
See [Memory Architecture](architecture/memory-and-context-redesign.md)
```

Use relative paths from the current doc location.
