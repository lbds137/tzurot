# Backup Command Status

## Current Implementation

The backup command has been successfully ported to DDD architecture and is **now registered in the DDD command system**.

### Recent Changes (2025-06-19)

1. ✅ **Registered in CommandIntegration**: The BackupCommand is now imported and registered in `/src/application/commands/CommandIntegration.js`
2. ⚠️ **No Feature Flag**: Unlike other DDD commands, there's no specific feature flag for the backup command yet
3. ⚠️ **Legacy Handler Still Active**: The legacy backup handler at `/src/commands/handlers/backup.js` is still present

### Current Status

The DDD backup command is now available when the DDD command integration is enabled:
- **DDD Implementation**: `/src/application/commands/utility/BackupCommand.js`
- **Legacy Implementation**: `/src/commands/handlers/backup.js` (still present)

### Feature Flag Recommendation

To control rollout of the DDD backup command, consider adding a feature flag in FeatureFlags.js:
```javascript
// Command system flags
'ddd.commands.backup': false, // Add this flag for controlled rollout
```

### Command Routing

Currently, which implementation is used depends on:
- If `ddd.commands.integration` is enabled → Uses DDD implementation
- Otherwise → Falls back to legacy handler

### Testing Access

- When DDD commands are enabled: The new implementation is used
- When DDD commands are disabled: Legacy implementation via `!tz backup`

### Testing the DDD Implementation

The DDD implementation is fully tested with 95.94% coverage and can be found at:
- Implementation: `/src/application/commands/utility/BackupCommand.js`
- Tests: `/tests/unit/application/commands/utility/BackupCommand.test.js`

### Migration Path

1. Enable the DDD command alongside the legacy command
2. Test in production with a feature flag
3. Gradually migrate users to the new implementation
4. Remove the legacy handler once stable

## Implementation Details

The DDD backup command provides:
- ✅ Complete feature parity with legacy command
- ✅ Standardized Discord embeds with color coding
- ✅ Privacy-compliant session cookie handling
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (95.94%)
- ✅ Clean architecture with dependency injection
- ✅ Injectable timer patterns for testability

## Next Steps

To activate the DDD backup command:
1. Follow the enablement steps above
2. Test with a small group of users
3. Monitor for any issues
4. Gradually roll out to all users
