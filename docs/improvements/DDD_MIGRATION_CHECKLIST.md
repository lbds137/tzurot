## Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **Stop and Reassess If:**
- Any phase takes > 50% longer than estimated
- Production incidents increase
- Team morale declining
- Pressure to compromise quality
- Shortcuts being proposed

## Remember

> "The migration is not complete until the old code is deleted."

Each checkbox represents a concrete step toward a maintainable architecture. Skip none.
