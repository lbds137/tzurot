# Codebase Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the Tzurot codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and structure.

## Completed Refactorings

- âœ… Separated embed functionality into distinct modules:
  - `embedBuilders.js` for creating Discord UI embeds
  - `embedUtils.js` for processing embeds in messages

## Recommended Refactorings

### 1. Standardize Module Organization

- Move all utility modules to `/src/utils/` directory
- Ensure each utility has a specific, well-defined purpose
- Group related utilities together by function (e.g., `media/`, `embed/`, etc.)

### 2. Standardize Import Style

- Move all import statements to the top of files
- Replace inline requires with top-level imports
- Use consistent import ordering (e.g., external packages first, then internal modules)

### 3. Handler Organization

- Create a structured `handlers` directory with clear organization
- Split large handler files into smaller, more focused modules
- Standardize handler function signatures and return values

### 4. Component Structure

- Implement a more structured component-based architecture
- Define clear interfaces between components
- Create higher-level abstractions for common patterns

### 5. State Management

- Implement a more structured approach to state management
- Replace global state with dependency injection where appropriate
- Use context objects to pass state through the application

### 6. Error Handling

- Implement a consistent error handling strategy
- Create a centralized error handling system
- Use structured error types with proper inheritance

### 7. Documentation Updates

- Ensure all new modules have proper JSDoc comments
- Update README files to reflect architectural changes
- Create architectural diagrams to visualize component relationships

## Implementation Strategy

For each refactoring task:

1. Create a detailed plan with specific files to modify
2. Write tests before making changes (test-driven development)
3. Make changes incrementally, verifying tests pass at each step
4. Update documentation as parts of the refactoring are completed
5. Review code for consistency and potential issues
6. Merge changes when a complete logical unit is finished

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**
   - Standardize module organization
   - Complete handlers organization
   - Implement consistent error handling

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Standardize import style
   - Update component structure
   - Improve state management

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Documentation updates
   - Minor code style improvements
   - Performance optimizations

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (High Priority)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Lower Priority)**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 5-8 weeks of focused development effort.

## Success Metrics

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. All code passes existing tests
2. Code maintainability metrics improve (e.g., cognitive complexity, method size)
3. New features can be added more easily
4. Bugs are easier to locate and fix
5. Documentation accurately reflects the codebase structure
