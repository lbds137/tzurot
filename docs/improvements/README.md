## How to Use This Documentation

### If you're a developer:
1. Read `DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for current status
2. Review `DDD_PHASE_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for what's been done
3. Check `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md` for Phase 2 details
4. Follow `DDD_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` for next steps

### If you're a stakeholder:
1. Read `DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` 
2. Understand why `FEATURE_FREEZE_NOTICE.md` is critical
3. Review timeline in `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md`

### If you're joining the project:
1. Start with `TECHNICAL_DEBT_INVENTORY.md` to understand the problems
2. Read `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md` for the solution
3. Check current phase in `DDD_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## Remember

> "We have 24 improvement documents because we kept starting fixes without finishing them. This time, we finish."

The DDD migration is not another improvement proposal. It's the improvement that makes all other improvements possible.
