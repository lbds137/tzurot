4. Follow `DDD_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` for next steps

### If you're a stakeholder:
1. Read `DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` 
2. Understand why `FEATURE_FREEZE_NOTICE.md` is critical
3. Review timeline in `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md`

## Remember

> "We have 24 improvement documents because we kept starting fixes without finishing them. This time, we finish."

The DDD migration is not another improvement proposal. It's the improvement that makes all other improvements possible.
