## How to Use This Documentation

### If you're a developer:
1. Read `DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
2. Check `FEATURE_FREEZE_NOTICE.md` before any work
3. Follow `DDD_PHASE_0_GUIDE.md` for this week's tasks

### If you're a stakeholder:
1. Read `DDD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` 
2. Understand why `FEATURE_FREEZE_NOTICE.md` is critical
3. Review timeline in `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md`

### If you're joining the project:
1. Start with `TECHNICAL_DEBT_INVENTORY.md` to understand the problems
2. Read `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_PLAN.md` for the solution
3. Check current phase in `DDD_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## Remember

> "We have 24 improvement documents because we kept starting fixes without finishing them. This time, we finish."

The DDD migration is not another improvement proposal. It's the improvement that makes all other improvements possible.
