# Coding Standards

## JavaScript Style Guide

This project follows a consistent coding style. Here are the key guidelines:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use single quotes for strings
- Always use semicolons
- Limit line length to 100 characters

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks around async operations
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Don't swallow errors (empty catch blocks)

## Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Document non-obvious code sections

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
