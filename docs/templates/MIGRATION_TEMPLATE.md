## Overview

**Problem**: [What bug/issue are we fixing?]

**Solution**: [High-level description of the migration]

**Risk**: [What could go wrong? What's at stake?]

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Migration tested in local development
- [ ] Migration tested in Railway development environment
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Migration script is idempotent (can run multiple times)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Team notified (if applicable)
- [ ] Low-traffic window scheduled (if needed)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
railway run --environment production pg_dump > backups/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup size
ls -lh backups/backup-*.sql

# Test restore on development (optional but recommended)
railway run --environment development psql < backups/backup-*.sql
```

### Step 2: [First Migration Step]

**What it does**: [Clear explanation]

**SQL/Command**:
```bash
# Your command here
```

**Expected output**:
```
[What you should see]
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# How to verify this step worked
```

### Step 3: [Second Migration Step]

[Repeat for each step...]

### Step N: Final Verification

```bash
# Comprehensive checks to ensure migration succeeded
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Migration Fails at Step 1

```bash
# Specific rollback commands
```

### If Migration Fails at Step 2

```bash
# Specific rollback commands
```

### Nuclear Option (Restore from Backup)

```bash
# Drop and restore entire database
railway run --environment production psql < backups/backup-[timestamp].sql

# Mark Prisma migrations as rolled back
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back [migration-name]
```

---

## Post-Migration Verification

### Database Checks

```sql
-- Verify schema changes
\d [table_name]

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_rows,
  COUNT(DISTINCT [key_column]) as unique_values,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE [key_column] IS NULL) as null_values
FROM [table_name];
```

### Application Checks

- [ ] All services restarted successfully
- [ ] No errors in logs (check last 100 lines)
- [ ] Test basic user flow (e.g., send message, get response)
- [ ] Test edge cases affected by migration
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours for issues

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check service health
railway logs --service [service] --tail 100

# Check for errors
railway logs --service [service] | grep -i error

# Monitor database connections
railway run psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'railway';"
```
