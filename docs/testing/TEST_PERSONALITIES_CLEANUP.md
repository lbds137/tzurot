# Test Personalities Cleanup

## Issue

During development and testing, some test personalities were unintentionally added to the production data files. These test personalities were created by test scripts and were showing up in the personalities data:

```json
"test-personality": {
  "fullName": "test-personality",
  "displayName": "test-personality",
  "avatarUrl": null,
  "description": "",
  "createdBy": "test-user-id",
  "createdAt": 1747720407319
},
"test-personality-2": {
  "fullName": "test-personality-2",
  "displayName": "test-personality-2",
  "avatarUrl": null,
  "description": "",
  "createdBy": "test-user-id",
  "createdAt": 1747720407779
},
```

## Solution

1. Created a cleanup script (`cleanup_test_personalities.js`) that:
   - Identifies test personalities based on name pattern and creator ID
   - Creates backups of original data files before making changes
   - Removes test personalities from the personalities data
   - Removes any aliases pointing to test personalities
   - Saves the cleaned data back to disk

2. Updated test scripts to use mocks instead of real data:
   - `test_personality_registration.js` now uses a mock personalityManager
   - `test_add_deduplication.js` now uses a mock messageTracker and middleware

## Results

The cleanup script successfully removed 2 test personalities from the data. The updated test scripts now run with proper isolation, ensuring that tests don't unintentionally modify production data.

## Best Practices for Future Testing

1. **Use Mocks**: Always create and use mocks for tests that would otherwise write to the filesystem.

2. **Environment Detection**: Tests should check for the test environment and use alternate storage or in-memory storage:
   ```javascript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
     // Use in-memory storage or test-specific storage
   }
   ```

3. **Isolate Test Data**: Use unique file paths or in-memory data structures for test data.

4. **Add Test Flag**: Consider adding a "test" flag to the test scripts to make it clear they should not be run in production environments.

5. **Documentation**: Document test scripts clearly to avoid confusion between test and production code.

6. **Cleanup on Exit**: Add cleanup routines that run after tests complete, to ensure test data is removed.

## Cleanup Script

The cleanup script (`cleanup_test_personalities.js`) is now available in the scripts directory and can be run if needed again in the future:

```
node scripts/cleanup_test_personalities.js
```

This script includes backup functionality to ensure no data is lost during the cleanup process.
