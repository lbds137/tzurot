### Major Update (June 9, 2025) - DDD Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰
**COMPLETED: All 45 DDD test files successfully migrated to consolidated mock system**

**Migration Achievements:**
- âœ… 45/45 DDD test files migrated (100% complete)
- âœ… All domain tests: 38 files covering value objects, entities, aggregates, repositories, services
- âœ… All adapter tests: 7 files covering Discord adapters and file persistence
- âœ… 500+ individual tests successfully migrated
- âœ… Consistent mock patterns established across all DDD tests
- âœ… Proper test type classification (@testType domain/adapter)
- âœ… Migration tracking documentation completed
- âœ… Backup files cleaned up (removed 564KB of temporary files)

**Benefits Realized:**
- ðŸš€ Consistent testing infrastructure prevents bugs like getAllReleases production issue
- ðŸš€ Standardized mock patterns improve test maintainability
- ðŸš€ Clear domain/adapter test separation enhances test organization
- ðŸš€ Consolidated mock system reduces test execution time
- ðŸš€ Future test development follows established patterns

**âœ… FIXED:** All test suites now passing! Fixed mock-system-example.test.js by removing problematic DomainEventBus import from DDD mocks
- Added validation error tests for all AI event types
- Identified test performance issues - no tests using fake timers
- Created comprehensive testing documentation:
  - TEST_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md - Performance guide
  - FAKE_TIMERS_STRATEGY.md - Timer optimization strategy
  - MOCK_VS_REAL_BALANCE.md - When to mock vs use real code
  - OPEN_HANDLES_ANALYSIS.md - Solutions for Jest open handles
- Improved anti-pattern checker to distinguish between module under test and external dependencies
- Root cause identified: Tests import heavy modules without mocking (not timer issues)
- **Fixed Issue**: 20 open handles from unmocked timer-creating modules
- **Fixes Applied**: 
  - Updated add.test.js to properly use fake timers with scheduler injection
  - Added profileInfoFetcher mocks to webhookManager.exports.test.js and webhookManager.simple.test.js
  - All open handles now resolved!
- **Additional Fixes**:
  - Fixed failing webhookManager.simple.test.js by updating profileInfoFetcher mock
  - Added fake timers to messageHandler tests to improve performance
  - Added fake timers to ConversationTracker tests with cleanup disabled
  - Fixed ConversationTracker stopCleanup test by creating tracker with cleanup enabled
- **Performance Improvement**: Test runtime reduced from 42.09s to 38.618s with fake timers

### Recent Improvements (June 6, 2025)
- Implemented local avatar storage system to prevent domain blocking issues
- Added comprehensive tests for avatar storage module (85.07% coverage)
- Added tests for avatar HTTP routes (89.23% coverage)
- Fixed deduplication issue where messages were processed twice
- Enhanced request ID generation to include message IDs
- Refactored webhook manager to remove avatar URL passing through multiple layers
- Overall coverage improved:
  - Statements: 87.45% (up from 86.12%)
  - Branches: 79.25% (up from 78.66%)
  - Functions: 83.73% (up from 82.04%)
  - Lines: 87.75% (up from 86.42%)

## Overall Coverage

**Latest Coverage (v2.0.5+):**
- **Statements**: 89.01% â†‘
- **Branches**: 79.88% â†‘
- **Functions**: 88.06% â†‘
- **Lines**: 89.2% â†‘

## Key Areas

### High Coverage (>90%)
- Authentication system (96.91%)
- Utils (94.02%)
- Media handlers (89.72%)
- Command middleware (100%)
- Core constants and utilities (100%)

### Low Coverage (<70%)
- Webhook Manager (24.34%) - The largest and most complex component
- Personality Handler (42.06%) - Complex personality processing logic
- Profile Info Fetcher (54.29%) - External API integration
- Conversation Persistence (60.78%) - File system operations

### Skipped Tests
All 8 skipped tests are in `AIClientFactory.test.js` due to Jest limitations with dynamic imports. These tests verify functionality that works in production but cannot be easily tested due to Jest's module system.

## Recent Changes

### Test Suite Completion (May 29, 2025)
- **All tests now passing!** Fixed all 356 previously failing tests
- Test suite fully operational with 134 passing test suites
- Only 8 tests skipped due to Jest technical limitations with dynamic imports
- All skipped tests are documented and understood (AIClientFactory module)

### Test Suite Improvements (May 27, 2025)
- Created comprehensive test fixing scripts to address common patterns
- Fixed aiService.error.test.js to focus on behavior rather than implementation
- Added OpenAI mock to global setup for consistent mocking
- Fixed syntax errors in multiple test files from incomplete refactoring
- Improved test execution speed by 77% (from 62.69s to 14.27s)

### Previous Updates
- Updated aiService error handling to return user-friendly messages instead of HARD_BLOCKED_RESPONSE_DO_NOT_DISPLAY
- Fixed authentication header to use 'X-User-Auth' instead of 'Authorization' to prevent OpenAI client conflicts
- All personality interactions now require authentication
- Fixed personality persistence save functionality
