## Migration Approach

The migration process follows these steps:

1. Review the existing test file and its purpose
2. Create a new test file in the appropriate location with the new structure
3. Adapt tests to use the new command handler implementation
4. Ensure tests pass and maintain the same coverage
5. Document any issues or special handling in this file
6. Mark as completed when fully migrated and tests pass

## Progress Summary

- Total Command Tests: 16
- Completed: 2 (info, ping)
