# Test Coverage Analysis

Based on the test coverage report, here are the areas that need the most attention:

## Critical Low Coverage Areas (< 10%)

### 1. `src/services/PersonalityDataService.js` - 6.32% coverage
- **Purpose**: Handles personality data with migration, conversation contexts, chat history, memories
- **Status**: NO TESTS AT ALL
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality without any tests

### 2. Files in `src/` directory with very low coverage:
- `commandProcessor.js` - 0% coverage
- `commandValidation.js` - 0% coverage  
- `healthCheck.js` - 0% coverage
- `httpServer.js` - 0% coverage
- `middleware.js` - 0% coverage
- `utils.js` - 0% coverage
- `webhookManager.js` - 0% coverage (This is critical!)
- `webhookServer.js` - 0% coverage

## Medium Coverage Areas (60-80%)

### 1. `auth.js` - 61.11% coverage
- Missing coverage for error handling paths
- Authentication flows not fully tested

### 2. `messageTracker.js` - 29.54% coverage  
- Core deduplication logic poorly tested

### 3. `aliasResolver.js` - 44.73% coverage
- Critical for personality resolution

### 4. `src/handlers/*` - 74.12% average
- Message handling logic needs more tests

### 5. `src/infrastructure/backup` - 74.06% coverage
- Backup functionality partially tested

## Recommended Testing Priority

1. **PersonalityDataService** - Create comprehensive tests
2. **webhookManager.js** - Critical for Discord integration
3. **messageTracker.js** - Deduplication is critical
4. **aliasResolver.js** - Core personality functionality
5. **auth.js** - Security critical

## Quick Wins (Simple to test)
- `utils.js` - Utility functions are usually easy to test
- `constants.js` - Already 100% but verify
- Value objects in domain layer
