# Test Mock Pattern Enforcement Summary

## 🛡️ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Automated Checks**
- `npm run lint:test-mocks` - Check all test files for mock pattern violations
- Pre-commit hook integration - Prevents committing tests with deprecated patterns
- Detailed violation reporting with suggestions for fixes

### 2. **Pattern Rules**
- **Deprecated**: `jest.doMock()`, legacy mock imports, `helpers.createMockMessage()`
- **Required**: Use `createMigrationHelper()` or `presets` for all command tests
- **Warnings**: `jest.resetModules()` which can break helper imports

### 3. **Migration Status Tracking**
- `node scripts/generate-mock-migration-report.js` - Shows migration progress
- Currently: 5% migrated, 88 files still using legacy patterns
- Clear examples of properly migrated tests to follow

### 4. **Documentation**
- `docs/testing/MOCK_PATTERN_RULES.md` - Complete rules and examples
- `tests/__mocks__/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
- `tests/__mocks__/README.md` - Consolidated mock system documentation

## 🎯 Why This Matters

1. **Prevents Regression** - Can't accidentally introduce old patterns in new tests
2. **Gradual Migration** - Fix tests incrementally without breaking everything
3. **Clear Path Forward** - Everyone knows which patterns to use
4. **Safety Net** - Catches issues before they reach production

## 📊 Current State

- **5 tests** fully migrated to new system ✅
- **2 tests** partially migrated 🚧
- **88 tests** still using legacy patterns ❌
- **12 tests** have `jest.resetModules()` issues ⚠️

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Enforcement Active Now)
1. All new tests must use `createMigrationHelper()` or `presets`
2. Pre-commit hook will catch violations in staged files
3. CI/CD can run `npm run lint:test-mocks` to enforce in PRs

### Short Term (Gradual Migration)
1. Fix partially migrated tests first (easy wins)
2. Run automated fixes for common issues
3. Migrate high-value tests (frequently modified)

### Long Term (Complete Migration)
1. Batch migrate similar test files
2. Remove legacy mock files
3. Simplify to only the new consolidated system

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
# Check for violations
npm run lint:test-mocks

# Generate migration status report  
node scripts/generate-mock-migration-report.js

# Fix common issues
node scripts/fix-jest-reset-modules.js
node scripts/fix-helpers-not-defined.js

# Check specific files
node scripts/check-test-mock-patterns.js path/to/test.js
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The enforcement is working when:
1. No new tests can be added with legacy patterns
2. Migration progress increases over time
3. Test failures decrease as consistency improves
4. Eventually: 100% tests use consolidated mocks

## 🤝 Developer Agreement

By implementing this enforcement:
- We commit to using the new patterns in all new tests
- We'll gradually migrate old tests when touching them
- We won't bypass the checks without good reason
- We'll help each other learn the new patterns

This enforcement system is our safety net to ensure we make consistent progress without repeatedly breaking the test suite.
