# Referenced Message Fix

## Problem Summary

Two main issues were fixed in the handling of referenced messages:

1. **Message Formatting Error**: The original issue was how we constructed the API message array when including referenced content. This caused errors in some scenarios.

2. **RequestID Generation Error**: A second issue was identified in the `createRequestId` function which was trying to call `substring` on complex object structures.

## Solution

### 1. Streamlined Message Approach

- Uses a single user message with prefixed reference text
- References are prefixed with clear delimiters like: `[Referring to message from User: "content"]` 
- Bot references use a special format: `[Referring to my previous message: "content"]`

### 2. Proper Multimodal Support

- Media from referenced messages (images, audio) is properly included in multimodal arrays
- For existing multimodal content, we add the referenced media appropriately
- For text-only messages with media references, we convert to multimodal format

### 3. Robust Error Handling

- Comprehensive try/catch blocks throughout the code
- Detailed error logging with full context information
- Graceful fallbacks for all error scenarios

### 4. RequestID Generation Fix

- Added proper type checking in `createRequestId` function
- Added special handling for all possible message formats
- Added error trapping and safe fallbacks

## Implementation Details

The main changes are in `aiService.js`:

1. `formatApiMessages()` function completely rewritten to:
   - Handle nested object structure with reference information
   - Extract and clean referenced message content
   - Format references appropriately
   - Include media content properly in multimodal arrays

2. `createRequestId()` function improved to:
   - Handle all possible message formats
   - Use proper type checking before calling string methods
   - Provide fallbacks for error cases

3. Error handling:
   - Detailed logging of issues with full context
   - Fallback processing in all error cases

## Testing

The solution has been verified with comprehensive tests covering:
- Text references from users and bot
- Image references (properly included in multimodal arrays)
- Audio references (properly included in multimodal arrays)
- Mixed content (referenced media with existing multimodal content)

## Future Considerations

With these fixes, referenced messages should now:
1. Work reliably for all message types
2. Properly include media content from referenced messages
3. Maintain a clean, consistent format for the AI to understand
