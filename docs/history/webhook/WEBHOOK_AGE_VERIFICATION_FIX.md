# Webhook Age Verification Fix

## Issue Description

There was a bug where the bot would incorrectly ask webhook personalities for age verification when replying to them. This issue occurred because the bot was not properly identifying its own webhooks as trusted sources that should bypass the age verification check.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `isProxySystemWebhook` function in `webhookUserTracker.js`. When the bot received a message from one of its own webhook personalities, it wasn't properly recognizing it as its own webhook, causing it to:

1. Fail the `isProxySystemWebhook` check
2. Not properly bypass the age verification check in the `shouldBypassNsfwVerification` function
3. Incorrectly prompt for age verification when responding to a webhook personality

This happened because there was no explicit check for webhooks owned by the bot itself - only checks for external proxy systems like PluralKit.

## Fix Implementation

The fix adds two new checks to the `isProxySystemWebhook` function:

1. **Owner ID Check**: Added code to check if the webhook's owner ID matches the bot's user ID
   ```javascript
   if (message.webhook && message.webhook.owner && message.webhook.owner.id === global.tzurotClient?.user?.id) {
     logger.info(`[WebhookUserTracker] Identified webhook as our own bot's webhook`);
     knownProxyWebhooks.set(message.webhookId, { timestamp: Date.now() });
     return true;
   }
   ```

2. **Application ID Check**: Added code to check if the application ID matches the bot's user ID
   ```javascript
   if (message.webhookId && message.applicationId === global.tzurotClient?.user?.id) {
     logger.info(`[WebhookUserTracker] Identified webhook with our bot's application ID`);
     knownProxyWebhooks.set(message.webhookId, { timestamp: Date.now() });
     return true;
   }
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Added a try/catch block to ensure any errors during the webhook identification process are caught and don't crash the application

## Testing

Created a new test file at `/tests/unit/webhook.bot.webhook.test.js` to verify that:

1. The bot correctly identifies its own webhooks by owner ID
2. The bot correctly identifies its own webhooks by application ID
3. Age verification is bypassed for the bot's own webhooks
4. Any errors during webhook identification are handled gracefully

## Related Files

- `/src/utils/webhookUserTracker.js` - Added logic to identify the bot's own webhooks
- `/tests/unit/webhook.bot.webhook.test.js` - New tests to verify the fix

## Preventing Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. When adding new verification or security checks, ensure that the bot's own webhooks are always trusted sources
2. Maintain comprehensive tests for all webhook identification and authentication bypass scenarios
3. Log clear messages when webhook verification decisions are made to aid in debugging
4. Consider adding a centralized registry of the bot's own webhooks to more easily identify them in the future

## Benefits

This fix ensures a smoother experience for users interacting with the bot's personality webhooks, as they will no longer see incorrect age verification prompts when replying to webhook messages.
