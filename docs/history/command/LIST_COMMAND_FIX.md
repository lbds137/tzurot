# List Command Fix

## Issue
The `!tz list` command was failing with the error "Invalid number value" when users with many personalities tried to list them all. This was caused by two main problems:

1. The `personalityAliases` object was being treated as a standard JavaScript object with `Object.entries()`, but it's actually a `Map` object.
2. Discord has a limit of 25 fields per embed, but some users had 65+ personalities.

## Solution
We implemented several improvements and fixes:

### 1. Fixed Map Handling
- Changed `Object.entries(personalityAliases)` to `personalityAliases.entries()` in `embedHelpers.js`
- Added robust error handling and type checking for the `personalityAliases` object
- Implemented fallback mechanism to handle cases where it might not be a Map

### 2. Added Pagination
- Implemented a pagination system in `createPersonalityListEmbed` (limiting to 20 personalities per page)
- Updated the command handler to accept an optional page number
- Added navigation links to move between pages
- Updated help text to document the new pagination feature

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try/catch blocks
- Improved logging for better debugging
- Added graceful fallbacks for error cases
- Ensured all values are properly formatted for Discord.js

### 4. Added Comprehensive Testing
- Updated existing tests to handle pagination
- Added new tests specifically for pagination features
- Added tests for edge cases and error handling

## Code Changes
- `src/embedHelpers.js`: Completely rewrote `createPersonalityListEmbed` function to handle pagination and properly use Map
- `src/commands.js`: Enhanced `handleListCommand` to support pagination and improved error handling
- Added documentation and tests

## Testing
All changes have been thoroughly tested with both unit tests and manual testing.

## Future Work
- Consider adding more navigation options (e.g., "first page", "last page")
- Add React button navigation for better UX
- Consider allowing filtering or sorting of personalities
