# Logging and Comment Cleanup

## Overview
Cleaned up overly dramatic logging messages and code comments that used terms like "CRITICAL", "IMPORTANT", etc. to make the codebase more professional.

## Changes Made

### personalityManager.js
- Changed "CRITICAL: We never automatically save here..." to "Defer saving to avoid multiple disk writes..."
- Changed "IMPORTANT: Mark this as a display name alias..." to "Mark this as a display name alias to handle collisions properly..."

### aiService.js
- Changed "CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION:" to "Check if this personality+user is in a blackout period to prevent error spam"
- Changed "CRITICAL DUPLICATE PREVENTION:" to "Create a unique request ID to prevent duplicate requests"

### webhookManager.js
- Changed "CRITICAL: threadId not set properly..." to "Error: threadId not set properly..."
- Changed "This is CRITICAL for ensuring..." to "This ensures we use the correct user's auth token..."
- Changed "CRITICAL: If this is an error message..." to "If this is an error message..."
- Changed "CRITICAL: Blocking error message..." to "Blocking error message..."
- Changed "CRITICAL: Allow ALL thread messages..." to "Allow all thread messages..."

## Rationale
While these comments were added to emphasize important code sections, they come across as unprofessional and alarmist. The cleaned-up versions:
- Still convey the importance of the code
- Are more concise and professional
- Don't use ALL CAPS unnecessarily
- Focus on what the code does rather than how "critical" it is

## Result
The codebase now has a more professional tone while maintaining clarity about important code sections. All tests continue to pass, confirming the changes were comment-only.
