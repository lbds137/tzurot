# Command Test Standardization PR

## Summary

This PR focuses on standardizing the test approach for command handlers. It updates four command handler tests to follow a consistent pattern, improving test organization, readability, and coverage.

## Changes

1. **Standardized Test Files**:
   - Reset command test: 100% line coverage
   - Status command test: 97.61% statement coverage, 100% function coverage
   - Verify command test: 91.66% statement coverage, 94.28% line coverage
   - List command test was already standardized, with 100% line coverage

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `COMMAND_TEST_STATUS.md` with progress metrics
   - Enhanced `COMMAND_TEST_STANDARDIZATION.md` with new examples and challenges section
   
3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Consistent mock setup patterns
   - Use of test helpers for creating mock messages and assertions
   - Better isolation between tests
   - More targeted assertions for complex features

## Testing Approach

Each standardized test follows a structured pattern:
1. All external dependencies are properly mocked
2. Tests are organized from basic functionality to edge cases
3. Test coverage is maximized, with special attention to error paths
4. Assertions are clear and specific

## Test Results

All tests pass, with improved coverage metrics:

```
PASS tests/unit/commands/handlers/list.test.js
PASS tests/unit/commands/verify.test.js
PASS tests/unit/commands/status.test.js
PASS tests/unit/commands/reset.test.js

Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       28 passed, 28 total
Snapshots:   0 total
```

## Coverage Improvements

| Command  | Statement Coverage | Branch Coverage | Function Coverage | Line Coverage |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| list.js  | 100%              | 100%           | 100%              | 100%          |
| reset.js | 100%              | 87.5%          | 100%              | 100%          |
| status.js| 97.61%            | 56.66%         | 100%              | 100%          |
| verify.js| 91.66%            | 76.47%         | 33.33%            | 94.28%        |

## Next Steps

We'll continue standardizing the remaining command handler tests in upcoming PRs, focusing on:
1. Converting tests for add, remove, alias, and deactivate commands
2. Creating a comprehensive test suite for command middleware
3. Enhancing the test helpers to support more complex scenarios
