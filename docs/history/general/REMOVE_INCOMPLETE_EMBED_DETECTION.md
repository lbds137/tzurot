# Removal of Incomplete Embed Detection

## Overview
Removed the obsolete `detectAndDeleteIncompleteEmbed` functionality from the error handler and message handler.

## Background
This function was originally added to detect and delete "Personality Added" embeds that were sent before the personality's display name and avatar were fully fetched from the API. These incomplete embeds would show:
- Display name as "Not set" or containing patterns like "-ba-et-", "-zeevat-"
- Missing avatar/thumbnail

## Why It's No Longer Needed
1. **Fixed Race Conditions**: We've fixed the underlying race conditions in personality registration
2. **Removed Self-Referential Aliases**: The removal of self-referential alias creation eliminated the early embed sending
3. **Complete Data Before Sending**: The add command now waits for all personality data before creating and sending the embed

## Changes Made
1. Removed `detectAndDeleteIncompleteEmbed` function from `errorHandler.js`
2. Removed the call to this function in `messageHandler.js`
3. Removed it from the module exports in `errorHandler.js`
4. Deleted the test file `bot.incomplete.embed.test.js`

## Result
The codebase is cleaner and no longer contains this workaround for a problem that has been properly fixed at its source.
