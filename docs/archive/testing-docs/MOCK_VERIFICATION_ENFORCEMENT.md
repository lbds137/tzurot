# Mock Verification Enforcement

## Summary

Following the `getAllReleases` bug caught in development, we've implemented enforcement to prevent tests from mocking non-existent methods.

## What Happened

1. **The Bug**: Tests mocked `githubClient.getAllReleases()` which doesn't exist
2. **Discovery**: Caught in development environment when testing GitHub webhook integration
3. **Root Cause**: Only ~5% of tests use our consolidated mock system
4. **The Fix**: Added mock verification to pre-commit hooks

## New Enforcement Rules

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
# Automatically runs on staged test files
node scripts/verify-mock-methods.js $STAGED_TEST_FILES
```

### What Gets Checked
- All `mockObject.method` patterns in test files
- Verifies the method exists in the real implementation
- Blocks commit if non-existent methods are found

## Current Technical Debt

### Problem Areas
1. **133 test files**, only **6 migrated** to consolidated mocks
2. **New components** (GitHubReleaseClient, VersionTracker) never added to `__mocks__/modules.js`
3. **No enforcement** allowed this pattern to spread

### Why Consolidated Mocks Matter
```javascript
// ❌ Ad-hoc mock - no verification
const mockClient = {
  getAllReleases: jest.fn(), // Typo! Real method is getReleasesBetween
};

// ✅ Consolidated mock - based on real implementation
const { modules } = require('../../__mocks__');
const mockClient = modules.createGitHubReleaseClient();
// Only real methods are available to mock
```

## Action Items

### Immediate (Completed)
- ✅ Added `scripts/verify-mock-methods.js`
- ✅ Updated pre-commit hook to run verification
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Updated testing guidelines with warnings

### Short-term (To Do)
- [ ] Extend `__mocks__/modules.js` with missing components
- [ ] Create GitHub issue to track migration progress
- [ ] Run full audit of existing tests
- [ ] Add mock verification to CI pipeline

### Long-term (Planned)
- [ ] Migrate all 133 test files to consolidated mocks
- [ ] Create TypeScript-style interfaces for all services
- [ ] Implement automated mock generation from source files

## The Boy Scout Rule for Tests

**"Always leave the test file a little better than you found it"**

### When Working on ANY Test File:
1. **Fix the test you're working on** (required)
2. **Migrate at least ONE other test** in the same file (strongly encouraged)
3. **Add missing mocks to `__mocks__/modules.js`** if needed

### Why This Matters
- At current rate (6/133), full migration would take years
- Each PR that touches tests should advance the migration
- Small, consistent improvements add up quickly
- Prevents future `getAllReleases`-style bugs

### Example Migration Commit Message
```
fix: update notification tests and migrate to consolidated mocks

- Fixed issue with notification test
- Migrated 3 additional tests to use __mocks__/modules
- Added GitHubReleaseClient to consolidated mock system
- Part of ongoing mock consolidation effort (now 9/133 complete)
```

## How to Fix Existing Tests

### Step 1: Check if Component is in Consolidated Mocks
```javascript
// Look in tests/__mocks__/modules.js
const { modules } = require('../../__mocks__');
// If createYourComponent exists, use it!
```

### Step 2: If Not, Add It
```javascript
// In __mocks__/modules.js
function createGitHubReleaseClient(options = {}) {
  const GitHubReleaseClient = require('../../src/core/notifications/GitHubReleaseClient');
  
  // Create mocks for ALL real methods
  const methods = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(GitHubReleaseClient.prototype)
    .filter(name => name !== 'constructor');
    
  const mock = methods.reduce((acc, method) => {
    acc[method] = jest.fn();
    return acc;
  }, {});
  
  return mock;
}
```

### Step 3: Update Your Test
```javascript
// Before
const mockGithubClient = {
  getReleaseByTag: jest.fn(),
  getAllReleases: jest.fn(), // ❌ Doesn't exist!
};

// After  
const { modules } = require('../../__mocks__');
const mockGithubClient = modules.createGitHubReleaseClient();
// ✅ Only real methods available
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Infrastructure Matters**: A good system unused is worse than no system
2. **Enforcement is Key**: Without automated checks, best practices drift
3. **Migration Takes Time**: But each bug prevented pays for the effort
4. **Documentation Alone Isn't Enough**: Need tooling to enforce standards
