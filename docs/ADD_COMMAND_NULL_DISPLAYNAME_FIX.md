# Add Command Null displayName Fix

## Issue

When adding a new personality with the add command, users were experiencing an error that prevented the personality from being added successfully:

```

```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a mismatch in parameter types between the `add.js` command handler and the `registerPersonality` function in `personalityManager.js`:

1. In `add.js`, the third parameter to `registerPersonality` was being passed as a string (the alias), when the function actually expected an object with a `displayName` property and other optional properties.

2. This caused an error when the code later tried to access `personality.displayName`, as the registration function couldn't properly handle the string parameter.

## Fix

The fix involved multiple changes:

1. **Updated parameter handling in add.js**:
   - Changed the call to `registerPersonality` to pass a proper data object with `{ displayName: personalityName }` instead of passing the alias directly.
   - Wrapped the registration process in a try-catch block to properly handle and log any errors.
   - Added separate handling for aliases if they are provided.

2. **Restructured code flow**:
   - Fixed indentation and code organization to properly handle the try-catch block.
   - Ensured all cleanup operations are performed even if an error occurs.

## Testing

A test script (`scripts/test_personality_registration.js`) was created to validate the fix by:
- Testing registration with a proper data object
- Testing registration with a string parameter (to ensure backward compatibility)

Both test cases pass, showing that the system now correctly handles personality creation.

## Additional Benefits

This fix also:
- Makes the code more resilient to errors
- Improves error reporting
- Ensures resources are cleaned up properly
- Follows the expected API contract for the registerPersonality function
