# System Prompt Artifact Fix

## Problem Description

Some AI responses have been leaking system prompt artifacts, such as:
- "You are Lilith" appearing in message content
- Other system instructions like "As [character], you..." showing in responses
- Role descriptions getting included in messages

These artifacts are clearly not part of the intended character response and should be filtered out.

## Implementation

Enhanced sanitization was added to prevent system prompt artifacts from appearing in AI responses:

1. Added a robust `sanitizeSystemPromptArtifacts` function in `aiService.js` with multiple filtering approaches:
   - Paragraph-level filtering to remove entire paragraphs containing suspect phrases
   - Regex pattern matching for common system prompt patterns
   - Personality-specific filtering based on the personality name
   - Contextual cleanup to fix formatting after removals

2. The sanitization process now:
   - Extracts personality name components for targeted filtering
   - Checks against an expanded list of 45+ suspicious phrases
   - Uses regex patterns to catch complex system prompt instructions
   - Provides detailed logging to track which content is removed and why
   - Maintains proper message formatting by fixing spaces and newlines

3. Key pattern types filtered:
   - "You are X" variants
   - "Your role is..." instructions
   - "As X, you should..." context setting
   - "Speaking as X..." role descriptions
   - "Never break character" instructions
   - "Remember you are X" reminders

4. Fixed content reassignment issues:
   - Fixed const reassignment errors in both `handleProblematicPersonality` and `handleNormalPersonality`
   - Added proper variable scoping to avoid modifying constants
   - Enhanced logging to track changes at each stage of sanitization

## Benefits

This enhanced filtering:
- Prevents confusing system instructions from appearing in messages
- Maintains a more seamless and immersive character experience
- Removes technical artifacts while preserving meaningful content
- Provides better debugging information through detailed logging
- Adapts to each personality by using name-specific patterns

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite was created to verify the sanitization functionality:
- 12 test cases covering various types of system prompt artifacts
- Tests for both simple and complex artifacts
- Tests for proper handling of personality names with hyphens
- Tests for edge cases like empty or null content
- Tests for preserving legitimate content while removing artifacts

The test suite is in `tests/unit/aiService.systemPrompt.test.js` and can be run with:
```
npx jest tests/unit/aiService.systemPrompt.test.js
```

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include:
- Regular expression optimization for better performance
- Adding more patterns based on observed leakage
- Expanding test coverage for more edge cases
- Fine-tuning the balance between aggressive filtering and content preservation
