   *     Generated client treats it like a GET for cache purposes — e.g.,
   *     React Query wrappers use `useQuery` instead of `useMutation`.
   *     Without this flag, POST routes are assumed to be mutating.
   *
   *   - `softDeleteAware`: the resource supports soft delete. Future
   *     codegen can honor this to add `includeDeleted?: boolean` to list
   *     queries or warn when a caller fetches a soft-deleted entity. Set
   *     on the resource-level routes (list, get-by-id) that participate
   *     in the soft-delete cycle, not on the delete operation itself.
   *
   *   - `idempotent`: route is safe to retry without side effects beyond
   *     the first call. Replaying the SAME request lands the SAME 2xx
   *     response. Examples: PUT routes (HTTP convention), `setFocus`
   *     (state-set with same body). Retry layers reading this tag MAY
   *     auto-retry on network failure without surfacing an error.
   *
   *   - `atMostOnce`: route mutates AND is guarded by a single-use
   *     token (or similar at-most-once mechanism). Replaying the SAME
   *     request yields a 4xx token-expired error even though the
   *     original mutation succeeded server-side. The opposite of
   *     `idempotent` — a retry layer reading this tag must NOT
   *     auto-retry, because the spurious 4xx would surface a recoverable
   *     server-side success as a user-facing failure. Used by
   *     preview-token / purge-token destructive batch operations.

   *   - Mutual-exclusivity invariants (enforced by manifest tests):
