# Testing Steps for Import Tool

## Step 1: Create Railway Volume (Dashboard)

Since Railway CLI volume creation is interactive, use the dashboard:

1. **Navigate to**: https://railway.app/project/industrious-analysis/service/api-gateway
2. **Click**: "Volumes" tab
3. **Click**: "New Volume" button
4. **Configure**:
   - **Mount Path**: `/data`
   - **Size**: 1GB (default is fine)
5. **Click**: "Add Volume"
6. **Wait**: For redeployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Verify Volume Creation

```bash
railway volume list
```

Expected: Should see a new volume attached to api-gateway at `/data`

### Create Avatars Directory

```bash
railway run --service api-gateway sh -c "mkdir -p /data/avatars && ls -la /data"
```

Expected: Should show `avatars/` directory

---

## Step 2: Test Avatar Serving

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://api-gateway-development-83e8.up.railway.app/health | jq '.avatars'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "count": 0
}
```

---

## Step 3: Run Qdrant Cleanup (Dry Run First)

Clean up existing Lilith memories with old format:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would change
pnpm cleanup-qdrant --dry-run
```

Expected: Should scan collections and report issues

### Apply Cleanup

If dry run looks good:

```bash
pnpm cleanup-qdrant
```

---

## Step 4: Test Import (Dry Run First)

Test with cold-kerach-batuach personality:

```bash
# Dry run first
pnpm import-personality cold-kerach-batuach --dry-run
```

Expected output:
- ‚úÖ Config loaded and validated
- ‚úÖ 107 memories found
- üîç Would create personality
- üîç Would download avatar
- üîç Would import memories

### Run Actual Import

If dry run succeeds:

```bash
pnpm import-personality cold-kerach-batuach
```

Expected:
- Creates personality in PostgreSQL
- Downloads avatar to /data/avatars
- Imports 107 memories to Qdrant
- Reports success

### Verify Import

```bash
# Check personality exists
railway run npx prisma studio
# Or via psql:
railway run psql -c "SELECT id, name, slug FROM personalities WHERE slug='cold-kerach-batuach';"

# Check avatar was downloaded
railway run --service api-gateway sh -c "ls -la /data/avatars/"

# Test avatar serving
curl https://api-gateway-development-83e8.up.railway.app/avatars/cold-kerach-batuach.png -I

# Check health shows avatar
curl https://api-gateway-development-83e8.up.railway.app/health | jq '.avatars'
```

---

## Step 5: Test Bot with Imported Personality

1. **In Discord**: Send message mentioning the personality
   ```
   @cold test message
   ```

2. **Expected**: Bot should respond using the imported personality with its memories

3. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs --service bot-client | grep -i cold
   railway logs --service ai-worker | grep -i cold
   ```

---

## Step 6: Import Lilith

Once cold-kerach-batuach works:

```bash
# Dry run
pnpm import-personality lilith --dry-run

# If good, import
pnpm import-personality lilith
```

Note: Lilith may already exist, so use `--force` if needed:
```bash
pnpm import-personality lilith --force
```

Or just import memories:
```bash
pnpm import-personality lilith --memories-only
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Volume Not Accessible

```bash
# Check mount
railway run --service api-gateway sh -c "mount | grep /data"

# Check permissions
railway run --service api-gateway sh -c "ls -la /data"
```

### Avatar Download Fails

- Check shapes.inc is still accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Fallback avatar should be used automatically

### Import Fails

```bash
# Check environment variables are set
railway variables --service ai-worker | grep -E '(QDRANT|OPENAI)'

# Check Qdrant is accessible
railway run --service ai-worker sh -c "curl $QDRANT_URL/collections"
```

### Bot Doesn't Use Imported Personality

```bash
# Check personality was created
railway run psql -c "SELECT * FROM personalities WHERE slug='cold-kerach-batuach';"

# Check default config link exists
railway run psql -c "SELECT * FROM personality_default_configs WHERE personality_id='<id>';"
```

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Railway volume created and accessible
‚úÖ Avatar serving works (health check shows storage)
‚úÖ Qdrant cleanup completes without errors
‚úÖ Import completes successfully
‚úÖ Avatar downloaded and accessible
‚úÖ Memories stored in Qdrant
‚úÖ Bot can use imported personality
‚úÖ Memory retrieval works in conversations

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Document any issues encountered
2. Import remaining personalities from shapes.inc
3. Consider implementing:
   - Batch import script
   - Migration tool for orphaned memories
   - LTM regeneration from chat history
4. Convert scripts to slash commands
