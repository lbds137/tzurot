## Next Session Goal

**🚨 START HERE: Investigate LangChain reasoning-extraction bug** — see [`docs/research/langchain-reasoning-extraction-bug.md`](docs/research/langchain-reasoning-extraction-bug.md). User-reported leak in inspect log surfaced what is almost certainly a long-standing silent bug: our `OpenRouterFetch` interceptor successfully extracts and injects `<reasoning>` tags, but they don't survive into LangChain's `BaseMessage.content`. Reasoning content has been silently dropped on every reasoning-enabled request for an unknown duration. Doc has full evidence, four ranked hypotheses, ordered test plan (start with `pnpm ops run --env prod --force tsx scripts/src/test-glm-reasoning-shape.ts`), and links to all the diagnostic infrastructure built tonight.

_Other priorities (lower urgency):_

1. **TTS Engine Upgrade (Active Epic)** — Chatterbox Turbo is the primary candidate. Next concrete step: spin up Chatterbox in a test container (Railway dev or local) and feed it a character reference audio. Compare quality vs. Pocket TTS and ElevenLabs.
2. **Identity Hardening — final cleanup** (atomic bundle) — flip `requireProvisionedUser` shadow-mode → strict 400; delete `getOrCreateUserShell`. Canary window closed (~2026-04-25 earliest), safe to start anytime now.
3. **Post-deploy DM subscription loss fix** — HIGH priority, two-layer warmer spec-ready.

## Active Task

_None. Session paused after PR #891 merged + post-merge cleanup committed + develop history fully cleaned._

## Completed This Session (2026-04-24)

### Morning: three Quick Wins shipped

- **PR #885** (merged): autocomplete sentinel guards across 19 consumer sites. 5 review rounds.
- **PR #886** (merged): typing-indicator error classifier. 5 review rounds.
- **PR #887** (merged): schema CHECK-constraint preservation in pglite generator. 5 review rounds.

### Afternoon: rule infra + GLM-4.7 production bug

- **PR #888** (merged): GLM-4.7 meta-preamble leak fix — same bug class as GLM-4.5-Air (PR #875), new tag vocabulary (`<user>/<character>/<analysis>`). 5 rounds, first real application of the new review-response rule.
- **`08-review-response.md`** rule designed via three-model council (Gemini 3.1 Pro → Kimi K2.6 → GLM-5.1). Replaces "report only, never fix" with tiered procedure auto-applying trivial edit shapes via `--fixup` commits, test-gated.

### Evening: attachment-download lift + Quick Wins #6, #7, #2 + #3

- **PR #889** (merged): **structural fix for the 2026-04-23 timeout incident** — moved attachment-byte download from api-gateway sync handler to ai-worker pipeline. Beta.104 band-aided this with a 60s client timeout; this is the real fix. 5 commits in PR (bot-client proxyURL fix, ai-worker DownloadAttachmentsStep + SSRF guards, api-gateway strip, test fixture URLs, BACKLOG removal). 9 review rounds — 1 real bug caught (queue-age gate ordering on text-only jobs), rest polish. Required develop history cleanup post-merge.
- **PR #890** (merged): harden downloadAll error-handling + aggregate payload cap. Three Quick Wins (#6 + #7 + #2) bundled because they all touched `DownloadAttachmentsStep.process()`/`downloadAll()`. New `JobPayloadTooLargeError` + 50 MiB aggregate cap. 4 review rounds. Required develop history cleanup post-merge (4 visible `fixup!` commits collapsed via force-push).
- **PR #891** (merged): queue-age gate for `AudioTranscriptionJob` (Quick Win #3). New `jobAgeGate.ts` shared helper. 4 review rounds. Clean single-commit merge.

### Workflow infrastructure (the big structural fix)

- **CI `fixup-check` job** added in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fails the build if any branch commit has a `fixup!`/`squash!` subject. Gates the merge button structurally so the "forgot to autosquash" failure mode (which bit us 2× in this session) is now impossible. Council (Gemini 3.1 Pro) pushed back on my initial proposal to drop the fixup workflow entirely — argued the right fix was the CI check, not workflow simplification. They were correct.
- **`08-review-response.md` rule 3 amended** — clarified that `gh pr merge --rebase` does NOT autosquash, prescribed the correct pre-merge sequence, named the rebase-strategy / per-push-rebase conflation that initially caused unnecessary force-push churn.
- **Auto-memory `feedback_no_force_push_per_round.md`** — captures both the original conflation incident AND the secondary "rule was wrong about gh pr merge" mistake, plus the council-led correction toward the CI check as structural fix.
- **Auto-memory `project_glm_47_quirks.md`** (from PR #888) — GLM-4.7 meta-preamble pattern; structurally similar to 4.5-Air but new tag vocabulary.

### BACKLOG triage + 7 follow-ups added

- 3 items moved out of Inbox: CI test-suite speed → 🧊 Icebox; typed aggregated error + hard-fail vs soft-error reconsideration → ⏸️ Deferred.
- 7 new follow-up entries surfaced by PR #889/#890/#891 reviews tracked in Inbox / Quick Wins:
  - Aggregate cap on partial-failure path (Inbox)
  - Consolidate DownloadAttachmentsStep onto `checkQueueAge` helper (Quick Wins) — bundled fix for duplicate `MAX_QUEUE_AGE_MS` AND `ExpiredJobError` ownership inversion
  - 5 GLM/CPD/test-suite watch-items already tracked, refreshed

### Develop history cleanups (force-pushed twice)

- After PR #890 merged via web UI without pre-merge autosquash, force-pushed develop to collapse its 4 visible `fixup!` commits.
- After PR #891 merged, force-pushed develop again to collapse the 6 PR #888 `fixup!` commits that had been on develop pre-CI-check.
