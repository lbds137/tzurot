## Next Session Goal

_No production issues active. z.ai integration end-to-end shipped (PR #921 + PR #924). Manual end-to-end verification + TTS upgrade work next._

1. **z.ai end-to-end manual verification** — per the plan in `~/.claude/plans/wondrous-rolling-moore.md`: (a) set z.ai-coding key via `/wallet add` → green validator response, (b) configure a personality with `provider: 'zai-coding'`, `model: 'glm-4.7'`, (c) send a Discord DM → check ai-worker logs for `effectiveProvider=zai-coding` and direct routing, (d) remove the key (or test as a different user) → check logs for `fallthroughTriggered=true` + `effectiveProvider=openrouter` with rewritten model `z-ai/glm-4.7`, (e) z.ai dashboard quota check confirms coding-plan quota was actually consumed (real-world signal). After verification, decide whether to seed a default `provider: 'zai-coding'` preset for users.
2. **TTS Engine Upgrade (Active Epic)** — Chatterbox Turbo is the primary candidate. Next concrete step: spin up Chatterbox in a test container (Railway dev or local), feed it a character reference audio, compare quality vs. Pocket TTS and ElevenLabs. Cost-bleed-driven (~$200/mo ElevenLabs).
3. **Quick Wins remaining** — delete `DM_RAW_GATEWAY_DIAGNOSTIC` env entry from Railway dashboard (no code), "make duplicate-exports + knip blocking in CI" (needs allowlist triage first), and the new `createMockPersonality` redundant `provider: 'openrouter'` overrides sweep (~80 fixtures, mechanical).
4. **Beta release (when convenient)** — develop has 3 PRs unreleased since beta.108 (#920, #921, #924). Cut beta.109 when ready. Plan to fold the `claude-review` skip-on-dependabot workflow change into the same release branch (it's the last-commit-before-release-merge item per the quick-wins entry — needs to land on develop alongside the release-merge PR to minimize the dark window where claude-review is broken).

## Active Task

_None. PR #926 (z.ai end-to-end UX fix — 3-commit bundle: DISCORD_PROVIDER_CHOICES + ZAI_VALIDATION_MODEL day-1 bug fixes + provider-aware footer URL routing) merged 2026-04-27 after 4 review rounds. Two real day-1 bugs from PR #921 (caught manually during attempted dev testing): the slash-command provider dropdown was missing z.ai entirely, and the validator probe used `glm-4.5-flash` (a model that doesn't exist on z.ai's coding plan — should be `glm-4.5-air`). Bidirectional guard tests added to `discord.test.ts` to prevent recurrence — every `AIProvider` enum value must have a matching DISCORD_PROVIDER_CHOICES entry. Bonus: incidental `encodeURIComponent` SSRF mitigation in chat-command response sender. **Next**: end-to-end manual verification of z.ai on dev (Railway auto-deploys develop pushes) — the integration is now genuinely testable._

## Unreleased on Develop (since beta.108)

- **PR #920** (`chore/post-beta-108-cleanup`, merged 2026-04-27) — chunker defensive truncation against off-by-N output (real Lilith bug), shutdown async-await (PR #913 follow-up), `CreatePersonaResponse` schema import (drift prevention).
- **PR #921** (`feat/zai-coding-provider-plumbing`, merged 2026-04-27) — z.ai Coding Plan as new `AIProvider.ZaiCoding` enum + endpoint + key validators (api-gateway intake + ai-worker runtime) + `ModelFactory` per-request provider override with provider-tier param filtering. PR 1 of 2; routing & auto-fallthrough come in PR 2. 6 review rounds, all asks resolved or absorbed into PR 2 backlog.
- **PR #924** (`feat/zai-coding-provider-router`, merged 2026-04-27) — z.ai PR 2 of 2: `ProviderRouter` (new service, 13 unit tests) encodes auto-fallthrough rule (zai-coding-with-key → direct route; zai-coding-without-key → rewrite to `z-ai/<model>` and route via OpenRouter; non-zai providers → passthrough). Wired into `AuthStep` via extracted `resolveLlmAuth()` helper. Threaded `provider` field end-to-end through `MappedLlmConfig` → `LoadedPersonality` → `ModelConfig`. Added `validateAIProvider()` runtime guard at ModelFactory boundary. Promoted 5xx classification to `ProviderUnavailableError` symmetrically across OpenRouter/ElevenLabs/ZaiCoding validators (was an asymmetric latent bug). 8 review rounds, all asks resolved or backlogged.
- **PR #925** (`chore/pr924-review-polish`, merged 2026-04-27) — 3-commit bundle of PR #924 review follow-ups: (a) invariant test for `tryResolveUserKey` no-cache-null-path (locks in PR #924's documented cache invariant), (b) optional `providerRouter?` constructor injection in AuthStep (test-isolation seam), (c) drop 50 redundant `provider: 'openrouter'` overrides in VisionProcessor.test.ts. First-try LGTM, 13/13 CI green. Discovery during planning: 4 z.ai backlog items were already done inline during PR #921 review — backlog cleaned up in same session.
- **PR #926** (`fix/zai-coding-discord-choices-and-validation-model`, merged 2026-04-27) — z.ai end-to-end UX fix after manual dev testing surfaced two day-1 bugs from PR #921: (a) `DISCORD_PROVIDER_CHOICES` was missing the `zai-coding` entry (slash-command dropdown silently omitted z.ai), (b) `ZAI_VALIDATION_MODEL = 'glm-4.5-flash'` was a hallucinated model name (correct: `glm-4.5-air`, the only 1× quota Haiku-equivalent in z.ai's documented coding-plan catalog). Plus `buildModelInfoUrl` helper that routes the response footer link to z.ai's blog (direct route) or OpenRouter (post-fallthrough), bidirectional guard tests in `discord.test.ts` to prevent recurrence on future enum additions, and an incidental `encodeURIComponent` SSRF cleanup in `chatResponseSender.ts`. 4 review rounds (1 autosquash gate + 3 review-fix cycles).
- **Dependabot PRs #922/#923** (merged 2026-04-27) — production + development dependency updates. Merged with explicit `claude-review` infra-fail (bot-actor reject); workflow fix to skip claude-review on dependabot is queued in `backlog/quick-wins.md` as "last commit on develop before next release-merge."
