## Session Goal

_One sentence on what we're doing today._

Workflow reorganization - consolidating ROADMAP + TECH_DEBT into BACKLOG.

---

## Active Task

_Cut from BACKLOG, paste here when starting work._

🧹 `[CHORE]` **Workflow Reorganization**

- [x] Consult MCP council on better workflow
- [x] Create BACKLOG.md (consolidate ROADMAP + TECH_DEBT)
- [x] Create CURRENT.md (slim down CURRENT_WORK)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow
- [x] Update tzurot-docs skill
- [x] Remove old files (ROADMAP.md, TECH_DEBT.md, CURRENT_WORK.md)
- [ ] Commit and push

---

## Scratchpad

_Error logs, decisions, API snippets - anything Claude needs to see._

Council recommendation: Two-file system (CURRENT + BACKLOG) instead of three files.

- Organize by TIME not TYPE
- Tech debt is just a feature where your future self is the customer
- Use tags: 🏗️ [LIFT], ✨ [FEAT], 🐛 [FIX], 🧹 [CHORE]
