### Theme: Voice Engine

_Focus: Two-tier voice system (self-hosted free + ElevenLabs BYOK premium) for both STT and TTS._

**Status**: Phases 1–4.6 shipped. Free tier (Parakeet TDT + Pocket TTS) in v3.0.0-beta.89. ElevenLabs BYOK (Phase 4) in PR #727. Configurable TTS model + cleanup (Phase 4.6) in PR #729. Dev-testing fixes (scoped-key detection, voice auto-reclone, STT userId) in v3.0.0-beta.90.

| Tier               | STT                         | TTS               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Free (self-hosted) | NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 | Kyutai Pocket TTS |
| Premium (BYOK)     | ElevenLabs Scribe v2        | ElevenLabs v3     |

#### Phases 1-4.6 (COMPLETE)

All shipped across beta.89-90 + PRs #710, #727, #729, #731-733. Key milestones:

- **Phase 1**: Python FastAPI voice-engine service (Parakeet TDT STT + Pocket TTS), Railway Serverless
- **Phase 2**: ai-worker VoiceEngineClient integration, replaced Whisper STT
- **Phase 3/3b**: TTS pipeline (TTSStep, chunked synthesis, Redis audio storage), `/character voice` command, config cascade wiring
- **Phase 4/4.5**: ElevenLabs BYOK (TTS, STT, voice cloning, slot management), Whisper removal
- **Phase 4.6**: Configurable TTS model (`/settings voices model`), CPD cleanup (152→146)

See git history for detailed task lists.

#### Phase 5: Shapes.inc Voice Field Import

Import voice configuration from shapes.inc character data.

- [ ] Map shapes.inc `voice_model`, `voice_id`, `voice_stability` fields to Tzurot voice config
- [ ] Set `voiceEnabled: true` for imported characters with voice data
- [ ] Create voice states from imported reference audio if available

#### 🐛 Voice Pipeline Resilience (Cold Start + Timeout Architecture)

Intermittent failures from Railway Serverless cold starts (~56s). Significant progress made in beta.92 and beta.93 work:

**Completed:**

- [x] STT bot-client timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout(120s)`) — PR #757
- [x] Adaptive TTS timeout (150s ElevenLabs, 240s voice-engine) — PR #757
- [x] Warmup polling returns `{ ready, elapsedMs }` for observability — PR #757
- [x] Timeout-aware user error messages — PR #757
- [x] ECONNREFUSED retry resilience for both TTS and STT — PR #759

**Remaining:**

- [ ] Parallel TTS chunking — synthesize chunks concurrently instead of sequentially (long messages still bottleneck)
- [ ] Better user feedback during STT wait — "Transcription in progress..." → "Taking longer than expected..." → error
- [ ] Transcription retry outcome surfacing — user sees generic error, not retry status

#### TEN framework / turn-detection (2026-07-05 ingest)

If live voice-channel conversation ever lands (vs today's attachment STT/TTS): **TEN_Turn_Detection** is a text-based semantic end-of-turn classifier (Qwen2.5-7B fine-tune, finished/unfinished/wait, EN+ZH, ~90.6% acc, Apache-2.0) — solves "when should the character speak" better than audio VAD. The parent TEN framework (10.8k stars, active) is a full realtime-voice-agent pipeline worth studying then, not adopting now.
