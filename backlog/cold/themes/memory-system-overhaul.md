### Theme: Memory System Overhaul

_Dependency chain: Configuration Consolidation → LTM Summarization → Table Migration → OpenMemory_

#### 1. ✨ LTM Summarization (Shapes.inc Style)

Verbatim conversation storage is redundant with extended context. Replace with LLM-generated summaries.

- [ ] Configurable grouping (5, 10, 50 messages or 1h, 4h, 24h time windows)
- [ ] Separate LLM call for summarization (fast/cheap model)
- [ ] Store summaries as LTM instead of verbatim turns

#### 2. 🏗️ Memories Table Migration

Two formats coexist (shapes.inc imports vs tzurot-v3 verbatim). Need unified format.

- [ ] Design unified memory format (draw from both sources)
- [ ] One-time migration of existing tzurot-v3 memories
- [ ] Run existing verbatim memories through summarizer

#### 3. 🏗️ OpenMemory Migration

Waypoint graph architecture with multi-sector storage.

- [ ] Design waypoint graph schema
- [ ] Migration path from current flat memories
- [ ] See `docs/proposals/backlog/OPENMEMORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

#### 🏗️ Per-User Quotas

No limits on memories per persona. Add `maxMemoriesPerPersona` (default: 10,000).

#### 🏗️ Contrastive Retrieval for RAG

Improve memory retrieval quality with contrastive methods.

#### 🏗️ Knowledge vs Memory Distinction

Distinguish user-specific memories from personality-wide knowledge (lore, backstory, reference material). Add `type`/`scope` fields, support personality-wide knowledge items not filtered by userId. See [`docs/proposals/backlog/MEMORY_INGESTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../docs/proposals/backlog/MEMORY_INGESTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for the full proposal (concepts valid, implementation TBD; originally drafted under the pgvector architecture).

#### ✨ Cross-channel history — smarter retrieval with limits

Limit messages per channel, prioritize channels with active conversations. Distinct from the user-driven `/history range` import (tracked in Inbox) — this one is about the automatic retrieval path that assembles context at generation time.
