### Theme: Package Extraction

_Focus: Reduce common-types export bloat and split bot-client, the largest package. Demoted from Next Epic 2026-04-15 when Identity Hardening promoted; resume after CPD Clone Reduction completes._

**Codebase snapshot (2026-02-12)**: 108K hand-written production LOC + 45K Prisma-generated.

| Package      | Files | LOC | Exports | Status                                                                              |
| ------------ | ----- | --- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bot-client   | 254   | 46K | 767     | **Outlier** — nearly half the codebase, primary extraction target                   |
| ai-worker    | 105   | 19K | —       | Healthy                                                                             |
| api-gateway  | 104   | 17K | —       | Healthy                                                                             |
| common-types | 99    | 16K | 607     | LOC is fine (45K "bloat" was Prisma-generated); **607 exports** is the real problem |
| tooling      | 61    | 9K  | —       | Fine                                                                                |

#### Phase 1: Assessment

- [ ] Reassess common-types export count — categorize exports by domain to identify extraction boundaries
- [ ] Profile bot-client's 46K lines — which subdirectories are self-contained?
- [ ] Reference: PR #558 analysis

#### Phase 2: Extraction

- [ ] Candidates: `@tzurot/discord-dashboard` (30 files, self-contained), `@tzurot/message-references` (12 files), `@tzurot/discord-command-context` (6 files)
- [ ] Re-evaluate whether common-types needs splitting or just export pruning

**Previous work**: Architecture Health epic (PRs #593–#597) completed dead code purge, oversized file splits, 400-line max-lines limit, and circular dependency resolution (54→25, all remaining are generated Prisma code).
