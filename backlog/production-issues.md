## 🚨 Production Issues

_Active bugs observed in production. Fix before new features._

- **`/character chat` orphans long-running jobs on free models** — bot-client polls with a 2-min cap (`TIMEOUTS.JOB_BASE` in `packages/common-types/src/constants/timing.ts:20`); free-model users see "something went wrong" while ai-worker successfully completes the job 4+ min later (compute wasted, response discarded). Paid-model users unaffected because they finish under the cap. Confirmed 2026-05-07: `Job llm-c5f21e08-6d91-443b-992e-544814562873` finished at processingTime=363266ms (6m3s) on ai-worker; bot-client gave up at 2m, surfaced "Error processing chat" from `chat.ts:53`. Surfaced via `/character chat random` with `baxter-madan-metoraf`. **Fix queued**: structural push-based result delivery — see `backlog/future-themes.md` § "Theme: `/character chat` — push-based result delivery + DM support". Scheduled before TTS-epic PR 3 continuation.

_Cleared 2026-05-06:_

- _**Persona "About You" modal silently truncates content to 2000 chars, causing data loss on edit** → resolved by **PR #983** (merged 2026-05-06, on develop awaiting prod release). The fix raised `persona/config.ts` `content` field maxLength from 2000 to `DISCORD_LIMITS.MODAL_INPUT_MAX_LENGTH` (4000), aligning UI with API schema. Companion changes lowered `personalityTraits` seed field cap from 2000 to `DISCORD_LIMITS.SHORT_PARAGRAPH_MAX_LENGTH` (1000) to match the API's existing `.max(1000)` (the inverse silent-rejection bug), and extracted the new `SHORT_PARAGRAPH_MAX_LENGTH` constant to eliminate six bare `1000` literals. Regression tests added at both schema layer (`personality.test.ts` boundary tests) and UI-config layer (`character/config.test.ts`, `persona/config.test.ts` maxLength assertions). Truncation warning audit for the persona dashboard remains tracked as a follow-up in `inbox.md`._

_Cleared 2026-04-29:_

- _**DM system prompt: non-active participants emitted with full `about_user` block** → resolved by **beta.110 / PR #932** (in prod). User-verified 2026-04-29 via fresh DM diagnostic dump: single `<participants>` block contains only the active user, `<about>` empty, no foreign persona injection. Matches the documented verification criteria exactly. The `loadPersonasAndResolveReferences` injection of personality-static-field-resolved users into the participants list is gone; text-replacement preserved._

- _**Vision negative-cache poisons attachments forever on transient AUTH failures** → resolved across two PRs:_
  - _**Beta.110 / PR #935** (in prod): architectural fix — drops L2 PostgreSQL, decouples cache policy from retry policy, AUTH cache TTL drops from "permanent" to 5 min so the user's vision recovers within 5 min of any underlying glitch._
  - _**PR #938** (on develop, ships next release): root-cause fix — discovered post-beta.110 that the "transient AUTH" was actually deterministic cross-provider mis-routing (z.ai key sent to OpenRouter for personalities with main=z.ai + vision=OpenRouter). New `visionAuthResolver` seam re-resolves the API key against the vision provider independently from the main-model resolution._
  - _User-verified on dev 2026-04-29 — image vision succeeds end-to-end. The recovery path is already in prod via beta.110; the underlying-cause fix ships with the next release._

_Previously cleared 2026-04-26 after beta.107 deploy — both prior entries resolved by structural fixes:_

- _LangChain reasoning extraction drop (~11% on GLM-4.7) → addressed by **#895** switching from transport-layer body mutation to `__includeRawResponse` post-parse, bypassing the LangChain `BaseMessage.content` round-trip where the injected tags were being dropped._
- _Preset autocomplete guest-mode trigger for logged-in users → addressed by **#906** flipping the wallet-API check from fail-closed to fail-open, so transient API blips no longer hide paid models from users with active keys._

_If either symptom recurs, treat as a regression and re-investigate from scratch._
