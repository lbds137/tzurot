## 🎯 Current Focus

_This week's active work. Max 3 items._

### Active

1. **PR-2n epic — Phase 2 (services extraction)** — see [`active-epic.md`](backlog/active-epic.md). Sequencing: `PR-2o ✅ → Phase 2.5 (a ✅ → b ✅ → c-i ✅ → c-ii ✅ → c-iii → d) → PR-2p → PR-2q`. Shipped 2026-06-04: **2.5a** (#1153, shadow hydration), **2.5b** (#1154, 3 gateway endpoints + dual-write), **2.5c-i** (#1155, write cutover behind `CONTEXT_MODE`), **2.5c-ii** (#1156, routing-read cutover: `HttpPersonalityLoader` + positive/negative cache). **2.5c-iii: iii-0 ✅ (#1157) → iii-a1 ✅ (#1159) → iii-a2 ✅ (#1160) → iii-a3 ✅ (#1161/#1162/#1163/#1165) → Fork C ✅ (#1166) → voice ground truth ✅ (#1169) → shadow burn-in ✅ GREEN (2026-06-08) → iii-b-1 ✅ (#1182) → iii-b-2 ✅ (#1183, thin payload) → iii-b-3 ✅ (#1194/#1195, last thin-payload holdouts dropped) → iii-cleanup ✅ (#1196, 6 carried fold-forwards). All shipped to prod in beta.130 (2026-06-14). NEXT: 2.5d** — delete legacy paths + `MessageContextBuilder` + bot-client's Prisma injections + the `CONTEXT_*` flags, tighten the depcruise guard. Unblocks PR-2p. Fold-forward details for 2.5d are in active-epic.md (§ 2.5d entry).

   _Epic work is prod-validated through beta.130 (#1200, 2026-06-14). Latest release: **beta.132** (2026-06-15). Unreleased on develop: #1225/#1226 (test-lint infra + the conversation-history ordering flake fix). See [CURRENT.md](../CURRENT.md)._

2. **Pre-beta.133 forwarded + slash-command batch** (user-directed) — working through the forwarded-message + slash-command items before the next release. Shipped: forwarded-link crawling (#1227), gateway write-timeouts (#1228, in review). Remaining: forwarded origin-channel enrichment, `/character chat` split (council-gated), `list`→`browse`, `/help` enhancement + terminology audit. Plan: `~/.claude/plans/calm-scribbling-scroll.md`.

### Quick-wins available between phases

None open — the z.ai admin-route test shipped (#1202), as did the earlier sweeps (#1147–#1151, #1191–#1193). See [`quick-wins.md`](quick-wins.md).

### Candidate next-themes (after PR-2n)

1. **Self-Hosted TTS + BYOK Re-Eval — BYOK bake-off** ([future-themes.md](future-themes.md)): pricing-and-quality probe of Cartesia / Fish Audio / PlayHT / Resemble vs current Mistral. CPU self-hosted side closed 2026-05-13 (Pocket TTS wins the 1–4 min use case).
2. **Voice references trim** ([inbox.md](inbox.md)): 8 personalities silently failing Mistral cloning (refs >30s). Owner-action, no code.
