### 🎯 Current Focus (max 3)

**🏗️ `[LIFT]` Spinoff-theme knockout + finishing-first — the release focus (no new epic)** — User decisions 2026-07-02/03: burn down the spinoff themes, and theme-CLOSERS outrank theme-starters. Roadmap + ordering in `active-epic.md`. Next pulls: job-payload contract suite (test-quality theme's founding motivation) · CPD campaign 1 (council-first) · legacy-column Phase A DROP (destructive; premigrate `--allow-destructive` at its release).

**✨ `[FEAT]` Boulder design pass — BEFORE 2026-07-07 (Fable→Opus handoff)** — User directive 2026-07-03: spend remaining strong-model days on design work for the hardest architecture (design > implementation for model-tier leverage). **Step 1: sweep `cold/queue.md` + themes for boulder-class candidates the shortlist missed.** Shortlist so far, each getting a written design artifact + council pass: (1) **design system / platform-portable UX layer** (breadth; evidence-ready via the 2026-06-28 UX audit); (2) **memory architecture adjudication** (depth; OpenMemory vs evolved-pgvector vs other — needs fresh upstream research first; INCLUDES lore books / user-loadable knowledge RAG); (3) **agentic scaffolding** (pipeline loop; unlocks image/video generation + web search/fetch tools; job-payload contract suite is the de-facto prerequisite). Design artifacts must be durable enough that post-handoff sessions execute rather than re-decide.

_beta.146 SHIPPED 2026-07-03 (11 PRs #1456–#1466): 2 prod provider-failure fixes, the Stryker pilot arc (config-resolver ratchet at 87.81 + CI `mutation-tests` job; suite-wide expansion still open), **3 themes CLOSED** (human-users-only, railway-log-DX, periodic-audit), weekly audit cron LIVE (maiden dispatch ✅ OK, Discord thread delivery proven end-to-end). Release review: "nothing survived verification as an actionable bug."_

### ⚡ Quick Wins (max 5)

_Small tasks that can be done between major features. Good for momentum._

_(empty — the beta.146 warmup sweep cleared all of them 2026-07-02)_

### 📥 Untriaged (max 10)

_New items land here for same-session capture. Route each to its home — `cold/follow-ups.md` (terse, one-liner), `cold/ideas.md` (speculative feature), `cold/themes/` (multi-phase epic), or Current Focus / Quick Wins — when you get to it. An empty Untriaged is the goal._
