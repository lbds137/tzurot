## 🚨 Production Issues

_Active bugs observed in production. Fix before new features._

- 🐛 `[FIX]` **Character field length caps cause silent data loss in dashboard edit + block API updates** — `PersonalityCharacterFieldsSchema` enforces length caps (1000/100/4000 chars per field, matching Discord modal input limits) at the Zod validation layer. Characters with legacy fields exceeding those caps (likely from shapes.inc imports or pre-cap data) exhibit two failure modes:

  **1. Silent data loss via dashboard edit** (CRITICAL): When a user clicks a character dashboard section that contains an over-long field (e.g., Biography → Appearance), `ModalFactory.buildSectionModal` silently truncates the pre-fill to `maxLength` chars at `services/bot-client/src/utils/dashboard/ModalFactory.ts:108` (`currentValue.slice(0, maxLength)`). The user sees no warning. If they submit, the trailing content is irrecoverably lost. The truncation is justified at line 107 as "Discord modals require value to be within length constraints" — a genuine API constraint — but the destructive behavior is hidden from the user.

  **2. Blocked API writes when body carries over-long fields**: `PersonalityUpdateSchema` composes `...PersonalityCharacterFieldsSchema.shape`, so any PATCH body containing an over-long field fails `safeParse` at `services/api-gateway/src/routes/admin/updatePersonality.ts:123`. The error reaches the client as `"personalityAppearance: String must contain at most 4000 character(s)"` via `sendZodError`. Whether an unchanged over-long field blocks unrelated edits depends on whether the dashboard sends partial bodies (only changed fields — safe) or full snapshots (unsafe) — the dashboard flow uses section-level modals with `extractModalValues` returning only fields in the submitted modal, which suggests partial-per-section, but needs confirmation.

  **DB survey** (Railway dev, 2026-04-11, script preserved in git history at commit `1de7f127` — deleted from working tree post-review per prod-safety concern: read-only script in `scripts/` was reachable from `pnpm ops run --env prod` and could be re-run against prod without review; results captured here are authoritative):
  - **168 total personalities**; **40 (23.8%) have at least one over-cap field** — roughly 1 in 4 characters is actively affected
  - `characterInfo` (cap 4000): **27 over-cap**, max 6082 chars (52% over cap), avg 2821. Required field, affects 16.1% of characters.
  - `conversationalExamples` (cap 4000): **18 over-cap**, max 7479 chars (87% over cap), avg 2589. 11.3% affected.
  - `personalityAge` (cap 100): **5 over-cap**, max 236 chars. The 100-char cap is clearly miscalibrated — users write prose like "late 20s but claims to be 300 due to fae heritage" that doesn't fit. 3.0% affected.
  - `personalityTraits` (cap 1000): **1 over-cap**, max 1172 chars. 0.6% affected.
  - Near-cap but not over: `personalityLikes` max 3915 (98% of cap), `conversationalGoals` max 3869 (97%), `personalityDislikes` max 3732 (93%). Users are actively writing up against the wall; these will flip over when caps are relaxed or content grows.
  - All-clear: `personalityTone` (max 875 / cap 1000), `personalityAppearance` (max 3480 / cap 4000), `errorMessage` (max 938 / cap 1000)

  **Severity reframe**: this is not a latent "edge case with legacy data" — 1 in 4 characters is affected today, with the worst offenders being the two long-form narrative fields (`characterInfo` and `conversationalExamples`) where users invest the most prompt-engineering effort. These are exactly the characters people are most likely to edit and most likely to lose work on.

  **Reference fix — prior art in `/memory` command**: The memory command already solves this elegantly for its own over-long content case (`services/bot-client/src/commands/memory/detailModals.ts` lines 61–156). Pattern has two complementary flows:
  - **Edit path** (`detailModals.ts:95-130`): detect over-long content before opening modal; show `buildTruncationWarningEmbed` (lines 61–75) with exact char count, destructive-action disclaimer, 200-char preview, and explicit `"Edit with Truncation"` opt-in button; only on opt-in does `handleEditTruncatedButton` (lines 132–156) run with the truncated content reaching the modal.
  - **Display path** (`detail.ts:85-155`): `buildDetailEmbed` returns `{ embed, isTruncated }`; when truncated, adds a `"View Full"` button that renders the complete content via a non-modal path, so users can still _read_ over-long content without losing data.

  **Proposed fix**: Port the memory pattern to the character edit dashboard.
  - Detect per-section whether any field exceeds its cap before opening the section modal
  - Show a `buildCharacterTruncationWarningEmbed`-equivalent with clear destructive-action warning
  - Only open the section modal on explicit user opt-in
  - Add a "View Full" affordance to the character dashboard for reading over-long legacy field values without triggering the destructive edit path

  **Architectural complication**: Memory uses hand-rolled detail modal flow (`detailModals.ts`), while character uses the generic `ModalFactory`/`DashboardBuilder` abstraction — the ports have different plumbing. Two migration strategies:
  - **(a) Port-in-place**: copy the memory pattern into character-specific handlers. Fast, but creates a second implementation of the same pattern.
  - **(b) Shared-utility extraction**: generalize memory's pattern into a `utils/dashboard/overLongFieldWarning.ts` helper that both commands use. Slower, but is the cleaner long-term direction and closes out the cross-cutting concern tracked in the Inbox item "standardize over-long field handling pattern."

  The rule-of-three trigger suggests _port-in-place first, then extract shared utility when a third consumer appears_. But if a third consumer is genuinely likely (e.g., persona character fields eventually develop similar issues), doing (b) directly may be worth it.

  **Out of scope for CPD Session 1** (2026-04-11): This fix is its own focused PR where the reviewer can compare the memory implementation to the character implementation directly. Investigation track for Session 1 produced this entry; the fix executes in a follow-up session.

  **Start**:
  - Reference pattern: `services/bot-client/src/commands/memory/detailModals.ts:61-156`, `memory/detail.ts:85-155`
  - Silent-truncate site: `services/bot-client/src/utils/dashboard/ModalFactory.ts:108`
  - Target for detection logic: `services/bot-client/src/commands/character/sections.ts` (per-section field arrays) + wherever the section-modal button handler lives in `utils/dashboard/`
  - Caps themselves: `packages/common-types/src/schemas/api/personality.ts:159-168` — consider whether these should stay as write-validation or move to display-only markers
  - Update-path Zod entry: `services/api-gateway/src/routes/admin/updatePersonality.ts:123`
  - Related cross-cutting item: see Inbox "Standardize over-long field handling pattern across commands"

  **Severity rationale for Production Issues placement**: the silent data loss is a real destructive-on-save bug affecting an unknown number of real users, and users have no affordance to detect it before save. This is strictly worse than "can't update" — which itself is a UX bug — because at least "can't update" fails loudly.

- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Normalize logger-message prefixes across bot-client (Pino convention)** — Most log calls in `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts` (and likely other bot-client modules) hardcode a module-name prefix into the message string, e.g. `logger.warn({ jobId }, '[JobTracker] Completed job after Xs')`. Per Pino conventions, the `createLogger('JobTracker')` call already tags every message with the module name in the serialized output — the prefix string is redundant and couples the message to the module name (rename → search/replace hazard). Surfaced during PR #820 round 5: I stripped the prefix from one new log in round 2 thinking it was cleaner, then R5 reviewer correctly flagged that leaving 1 without + 10+ with creates ambiguity for future authors. Restored the prefix in that PR to preserve consistency; this backlog item is to do the broader normalization as a dedicated pass. **Fix shape**: grep for `'\[\w+\]` in log-message strings across `services/bot-client/src/`, remove them, verify logs still carry the module name via the `createLogger` tag, update any regex-based log grep/dashboard queries that depend on the bracket prefix. Low risk; touches many lines but no behavior change. **Start**: `grep -rn "'\[" services/bot-client/src/ | grep logger` to enumerate, then tackle one module at a time. Possibly extend scope to api-gateway/ai-worker once bot-client is clean.
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **Typing indicator intermittently stops during long AI responses — investigate** — User has observed the "bot is typing…" indicator disappearing before the AI response actually lands, multiple times, not yet reproduced deterministically. Unclear whether this is a bot-side bug (failed `sendTyping` refresh not recovering) or a Discord client-side display glitch (indicator sent but not rendered).

  **Current implementation — two independent typing loops**:
  - `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts:85-149` — fires `channel.sendTyping()` every 8s (`TYPING_INDICATOR_INTERVAL_MS`) until the 10-min cutoff (`TYPING_INDICATOR_TIMEOUT_MS`) or job completion. Errors are logged and **swallowed** at lines 144-146 (comment: "channel might be temporarily unavailable"); the interval continues.
  - `services/bot-client/src/services/VoiceTranscriptionService.ts:186-198` — independent interval at the same 8s cadence for voice-transcription flows, also swallowing errors (lines 194-196).

  **Known constants**:
  - Discord's typing indicator expires ~10s after the last ping.
  - Refresh at 8s → only a **2-second buffer**. A single missed refresh can cause a visible dropout until the next 8s tick succeeds.
  - discord.js v14.26.2 (`services/bot-client/package.json`).

  **Hypotheses to investigate** (ranked by likelihood):
  1. **Rate limiting on `sendTyping`** — Discord rate-limits `POST /channels/{id}/typing` per-channel. When the bot processes multiple @mentions in the same channel simultaneously (e.g., two users pinging different personalities at once), two JobTracker entries fire typing every 8s each into the same channel, doubling the effective rate. Under concurrent usage this can hit the channel rate limit. The current `catch` block treats 429s identically to any other error — no backoff, no logging differentiation. **Cheapest investigation**: Railway log search for `'[JobTracker] Failed to send typing indicator'` grouped by channel and by 5-min windows. If rate-limited, retry-after headers should be attached to the rejected request in discord.js.
  2. **Handoff gap between VoiceTranscriptionService and JobTracker** — for voice-message flows: VoiceTranscriptionService runs its typing loop during transcription, then terminates its interval when transcription finishes. PersonalityMessageHandler then starts JobTracker's typing loop for the AI response. If the handoff takes >2s (voice transcription cleanup + AI job submission), the Discord indicator will flicker off between the last VoiceTranscriptionService ping and the first JobTracker ping. **Check**: grep for the handoff site — probably `PersonalityMessageHandler` or the voice-message path in `MessageHandler` — and measure the wall-clock gap between the two intervals.
  3. **Gateway disconnect/reconnect during long jobs** — if the bot's gateway connection drops and auto-reconnects mid-job, the `typingInterval` keeps firing in-process but the `sendTyping` REST calls may fail silently or queue. After reconnect, queued calls may or may not succeed. **Check**: correlate typing dropouts with `Client#disconnect`/`Client#resume` events. discord.js logs these at `info` if `rest.debug` is enabled.
  4. **Discord client-side rendering bug** — known anecdotally that Discord desktop and mobile clients sometimes fail to display the typing indicator even when the gateway delivered the event. More common on mobile and intermittent connections. **Not fixable bot-side**; only relevant to rule out. **Check**: does the user see the dropout on desktop, mobile, both? Reproducible in a second client?
  5. **Abuse-prevention heuristics** — anecdotal reports in Discord developer community that the server suppresses typing indicators that have been running continuously for "a long time" as abuse prevention. No official documentation. **Check**: does the dropout correlate with job age? Jobs >5 min showing dropouts more often than fast jobs?
  6. **discord.js bug or regression** — v14.26.2 is recent; check release notes for any typing-related changes. **Check**: GitHub issues on discord.js for `sendTyping` + `indicator` in the last 6 months.

  **Investigation steps (in order)**:
  1. **Differentiate error types in the catch block** — at `JobTracker.ts:144` and `VoiceTranscriptionService.ts:194`, classify the error: 429 rate-limit → log at warn with retry-after and next-refresh offset; network → log at info (transient); channel-gone (404 / 50013) → log at error and clear the interval (no point continuing). Ship this first — it's a prerequisite for every other investigation step because today the logs don't distinguish failure modes.
  2. **Add per-channel aggregation telemetry** — count of `sendTyping` calls and failures per channel per 5-min window. Surfaces rate-limit patterns. Can live in the existing logger output; no new infrastructure required.
  3. **Measure the voice-handoff gap** — instrument the transition from VoiceTranscriptionService → JobTracker with a timestamped log pair. If the gap is >2s on the reproducer cases, this is almost certainly the voice-specific failure mode.
  4. **User-side reproduction capture** — when the user notices a dropout next, they record: (a) channel, (b) approximate time (UTC), (c) whether it was a voice message or text, (d) whether it was a long reply or a short one, (e) client (desktop/web/mobile). Cross-reference with the differentiated logs from step 1.

  **Remediation options (pick after findings)**:
  - **If rate-limiting**: reduce refresh rate (8s → 7s widens buffer but also increases rate), OR coalesce typing loops per-channel (one loop per channel regardless of how many jobs are active), OR back off on 429 instead of silently retrying at the fixed 8s cadence.
  - **If voice-handoff gap**: continue the first typing loop across the handoff rather than restarting fresh. Pass the `sendTyping` responsibility through the VoiceTranscription → PersonalityMessage transition without a gap.
  - **If gateway reconnect**: subscribe to `Client#resume` and re-fire typing for all tracked jobs on reconnect.
  - **If Discord client bug**: nothing to do bot-side; document and close.

  **Why this deserves investigation despite being a "small" UX bug**: the typing indicator is the sole signal a user has that the bot received their message and is working on it. Dropouts → users assume "bot is broken" → they retry → duplicate requests → more load → more rate limits → more dropouts. The feedback loop makes it worse under load, not self-healing.

  **Start**: `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts:141-147` (the silent-swallow catch) is the bottleneck for every investigation step. Step 1 (error differentiation) is the cheapest action and unblocks the rest. Related existing item: the "JobTracker orphan sweep" entry directly below — if orphan sweep lands first, factor the error-differentiation change into the same PR since both touch the same interval callback.

- 🐛 `[FIX]` **JobTracker: orphaned entries leak into `activeJobs` when `completeJob` is never called** — `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts:137` deliberately keeps the job in `activeJobs` after the typing-indicator cutoff fires (comment: "KEEP tracking the job — result will still be delivered when it arrives"). That's correct for the happy path (job finishes late, `completeJob` cleans up). But if the caller crashes, or the worker drops the job, or the BullMQ round-trip never returns, the entry sits in the Map until the bot process restarts. Slow memory leak on a long-lived bot. **Fix shape**: at `clearInterval` time, schedule a grace-period sweep — something like `setTimeout(() => { if (activeJobs.has(jobId)) { logger.warn(...); completeJob(jobId); } }, GRACE_MS)` where `GRACE_MS` is generous (maybe 30 min beyond the typing cutoff). Grace period lets legitimate delayed results through; anything past the grace is a genuine orphan. Predates PR #819 — not a release regression. **Surfaced by**: claude-bot review on PR #819. **Start**: `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts:130-138` (where the clearInterval fires) — add the sweep there.
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **`checkNsfwVerification` silently blocks verified users on API errors** — `services/bot-client/src/utils/nsfwVerification.ts` returns `{ nsfwVerified: false }` when the gateway call throws. That's indistinguishable to callers from a definitive "user is not verified." Under a transient api-gateway outage, fully-verified users suddenly can't interact with the bot, and there's no way for the caller to handle the degraded-service case differently (e.g., allow-through with a warn log, or surface "check failed, try again" instead of "you're not verified"). **Fix shape**: widen the return type — `{ nsfwVerified: boolean; checkError?: true }` or a discriminated union — and update callers to distinguish "known-not-verified" from "couldn't check." Policy question per call site: some paths might want fail-open on error (trusted channels); others fail-closed (DMs). **Surfaced by**: claude-bot review on PR #819. **Start**: `services/bot-client/src/utils/nsfwVerification.ts` (return type); audit `grep -rn "checkNsfwVerification" services/bot-client/src` for call sites (likely 2-3).
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Automate step 5 of release flow ("rebase develop onto main after merge")** — The git-workflow skill documents this step but nothing enforces it. Got skipped after beta.98 shipped; showed up ~24 hrs later as "conflicts with main" on the beta.99 release PR (develop still had pre-rebase SHAs for beta.98-era commits while main had the post-rebase versions). The content was identical — git rebase auto-skipped via `--reapply-cherry-picks` behavior — but the PR looked scary until we diagnosed it. Fix shape: (a) add a `pnpm ops release:finalize` command that runs `git fetch --all && git checkout main && git pull && git checkout develop && git pull && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease` and prompts for confirmation at each step; (b) alternatively, extend `pnpm ops release:tag` (or whatever posts the GitHub release) to run the rebase as its final action; (c) add a pre-session-start guard that detects "main has commits develop doesn't have same-SHA" and reminds to finalize. Surfaced during beta.99 release. **Start**: `packages/tooling/src/commands/release.ts` — already has `release:bump`, adding `release:finalize` fits naturally. Test case: simulate post-merge state with a local-only `main` ahead of develop.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Schema audit: find other nullable-that-isn't FK columns and other schema concessions** — Phase 5b's NOT NULL fix revealed a pattern: `users.default_persona_id` was nullable at the DB level not because `null` was a meaningful application state, but because one code path (`getOrCreateUserShell`) was inconvenient to fix properly. The application enforced "non-null at rest" via code conventions instead of the type system. Similar concessions likely exist elsewhere — this epic has found three load-bearing workaround patterns (discord:XXXX dual-tier, shell-user, null default_persona_id) in ~6 months of v3 development, which suggests more are hiding. **Audit recipe**: (a) grep `prisma/schema.prisma` for `?` (optional) on FK columns and columns that are "always set" in application logic — for each, ask "can this actually be null in production, or is the app enforcing non-null via convention?"; (b) grep for default-value-that-never-applies patterns (columns with `@default` that callers always override); (c) grep Prisma `findUnique` / `findFirst` callers for `?.fieldName ?? fallback` patterns where `fallback` is never actually used in production — those often indicate a schema nullability that should be tightened; (d) grep for wide union types in TypeScript (`string | null`, `string | undefined`, domain enums widened to `string`) that the app narrows at runtime. Each finding is a candidate for the same NOT NULL / NOT NULLABLE / structural-invariant treatment 5b applied. **Why it matters**: every schema concession is a place where a future refactor can silently re-introduce a bug class — the 5b class was the persona-snowflake bug ("user appears as their Discord snowflake ID in prompts") that shipped undetected for 4 months. **Why out of scope of Identity Epic**: the audit doesn't have a single unifying theme — it's a discovery pass that will spawn multiple independent fix PRs. Best done as its own mini-epic after Phase 6 integration tests land (so we can lean on those tests when tightening invariants). **Start**: `prisma/schema.prisma` — enumerate every `?` on non-timestamp columns, cross-reference with `.findUnique` usage sites to identify which nullable values are never null at rest.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Real-Postgres integration test coverage for Phase 5 CHECK constraints** — `personas_name_non_empty` and `personas_name_not_snowflake` (added in Identity Epic Phase 5, 2026-04-16) are enforced at the DB level but can't be tested via PGLite. Prisma doesn't represent CHECK constraints in the schema, so `pnpm ops test:generate-schema` doesn't include them in the PGLite-derived test schema. Result: two invariants currently have zero automated regression coverage — a future migration that accidentally drops them (or a drift-ignore rule that over-matches) would pass all existing tests. **Fix shape options**: (a) add a dedicated real-Postgres integration test fixture that applies migrations to a real Postgres instance and exercises the CHECK constraints directly; (b) extend `pnpm ops test:generate-schema` to parse CHECK constraints from migration SQL files and append them to the generated PGLite schema; (c) scope these tests into Phase 6's end-to-end integration test work (Phase 6 plans a full-stack test from HTTP route through Discord interaction to prompt assembly — a real-Postgres fixture there would naturally exercise the CHECKs); (d) **intermediate cheap guard**: a `structure.test.ts`-style test that reads `prisma/migrations/*phase_5*/migration.sql` and asserts the CHECK DDL strings (`CHECK (LENGTH(TRIM("name")) > 0)` and `CHECK ("name" !~ '^\d{17,19}$')`) are still present. Doesn't catch "constraint applies at runtime" behavior, but does catch the scariest failure mode — a future drift-ignore regex that over-matches and silently drops these constraints during a later migration. Cheap to implement (~20 LOC + pattern match), no new infrastructure. Reasonable stopgap until the real-Postgres fixture lands. **Surfaced by**: claude-bot review on PRs #817, #819. **Start**: `packages/common-types/src/services/UserService.int.test.ts` — pattern already established for PGLite-backed integration tests; the extension is swapping PGLite for a real Postgres instance (probably via testcontainers or a local Podman Postgres connection). Naming + runner integration for real-Postgres tests is a structural decision to make at implementation time (does it go in `pnpm test:int` alongside PGLite tests, a separate `pnpm test:real-db`, or fold into CI differently? — no precedent yet).
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **`ForeignKeyReconciler.reconcileFkColumn` double-writes when timestamps are equal but values differ** — When `compareTimestamps` returns `'same'` and `devValue !== prodValue`, both branches at `services/api-gateway/src/services/sync/ForeignKeyReconciler.ts:148-170` fire in the same pass: prod gets dev's value AND dev gets prod's value. End result is a cross-contamination swap — each side ends up with the other side's value, and the next sync sees equal values as a no-op (so the damage is latent, not self-correcting). Dormant before PR #813 because the only deferred-FK column (`default_persona_id` in test fixtures) was blanket-excluded in runtime config; reactivated now that `default_persona_id` and `default_llm_config_id` flow through deferred-FK reconciliation for real. **Likelihood in practice**: low for a solo-dev project — requires a clock-equal write on both sides with different FK values (e.g., race between `/admin db-sync` and a simultaneous user-initiated preference change, or manually edited `updated_at` timestamps). **Fix shape**: in `reconcileFkColumn`, when `comparison === 'same' && devValue !== prodValue`, deterministically prefer one side (probably prod, matching "prod is source of truth" model) rather than applying both branches. Alternative: use a tiebreaker like row `id` hash so the choice is stable across reruns. Add a test in `ForeignKeyReconciler.test.ts` covering the `same + values-differ` case. **Surfaced by**: claude-bot review on PR #813 (flagged explicitly as pre-existing and out of scope). **Start**: `services/api-gateway/src/services/sync/ForeignKeyReconciler.ts:148-170` (the dual-conditional block) and the existing `should update both when timestamps are same` test — document the behavior change intent and pick a tiebreaker.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Enforce "human users only" for HTTP routes at the auth-middleware level** — PR #807 removed the 400-for-bot branch from api-gateway HTTP routes (NSFW verify, timezone, wallet, config-overrides, shapes auth/import/export, model-override, personality-config-overrides, llm-config) on the rationale that "HTTP routes aren't bot-accessible in practice — bots don't authenticate via session/discordId." That assumption holds today because the current auth flow (Discord OAuth → session cookie) only issues sessions to real Discord users. **Risk**: if a future auth mode ever allows bot accounts (service-to-service JWT for third-party integrations, machine-user API keys, OAuth app-installation flow, etc.), the bot-user path is gone from all those routes and would silently provision shell users for bot Discord IDs. **Fix shape**: add an `isBotUser` check to `requireUserAuth` middleware in `services/api-gateway/src/services/AuthMiddleware.ts` that rejects session subjects marked as bots before any route handler runs. This moves the guarantee from "code convention" to "middleware invariant" — route handlers would no longer need to care about the distinction. Cost is one check per request, applied uniformly. **Surfaced by**: PR #812 release reviewer observation F. **Start**: `services/api-gateway/src/services/AuthMiddleware.ts`; check how session data encodes bot status (likely not at all yet since current Discord OAuth doesn't issue sessions to bots — may need to add that field); add rejection test case.
- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Investigate Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS as a TTS engine candidate** — Google announced 2026-04-15 (https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-flash-tts/). Worth evaluating alongside the existing TTS upgrade research (Chatterbox Turbo, Voxtral, Fish Audio) in Current Focus. **Announcement highlights**: 70+ languages; Elo 1,211 on Artificial Analysis TTS leaderboard ("thousands of blind human preferences"); native multi-speaker dialogue support; audio tags for vocal style/pace/delivery control via natural language ("Director's Notes", "Audio Profiles" — zero-shot voice cloning NOT explicitly disclosed in the post); preview access via Gemini API, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI; SynthID watermarking. **Open questions for evaluation**: (1) pricing not disclosed yet — competitive with Voxtral ($16/1M chars) or ElevenLabs (~$60/1M chars)? (2) does "Audio Profiles" include true zero-shot voice cloning from a short reference clip, or is it preset-voice selection only? (3) free-tier quota on Google AI Studio usable for guest-mode TTS fallback? (4) latency vs ElevenLabs / Voxtral — not disclosed. (5) API stability risk — preview-only. **Action**: spin up a test against Gemini API with a reference voice file when hands-on eval happens for Chatterbox Turbo. If pricing and cloning check out, becomes another BYOK option in the TTS epic. **Start**: Gemini API docs (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), compare the output quality + cloning workflow against Chatterbox Turbo on the same character reference audio.
- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Proactive voice-engine warmup parallel to ElevenLabs TTS** — Currently when ElevenLabs fails and we fall back to voice-engine, the fallback path serially initiates a voice-engine cold start (~47s observed). Beta.97 widened the outer budget to 240s to make this fit, but the cold-start wait is still in the critical path for the fallback case. Proposed: kick off a voice-engine warmup `fetch /health` (fire-and-forget) at the START of every ElevenLabs TTS attempt, so that if ElevenLabs fails, voice-engine is already warm. Wasted warmup cost on ElevenLabs success is minimal (one `/health` round-trip). Requires careful handling to avoid thrashing voice-engine with requests. Low-urgency — beta.97 already unblocks the worst-case path. **Start**: `services/ai-worker/src/jobs/handlers/pipeline/steps/TTSStep.ts` `performElevenLabsTTSWithFallback`; consider a shared `VoiceEngineWarmup` helper that can be called from both ElevenLabs and voice-engine-direct paths.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Reduce ElevenLabs per-attempt timeout from 60s to 30-45s** — Beta.97 cut ElevenLabs retries to 1, but per-attempt timeout is still 60s (hardcoded in `elevenLabsFetch` via `AbortController`). When ElevenLabs genuinely can't respond, detecting the failure 15-30s earlier means the voice-engine fallback has more headroom. Requires measurement: what's the p99 ElevenLabs successful-call duration? If it's <30s, the 60s budget is 2x overkill. **Start**: `services/ai-worker/src/services/voice/ElevenLabsClient.ts` `elevenLabsFetch`; pair with the retry telemetry added to `withRetry` in beta.97 to measure the distribution before tuning.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Audit ElevenLabs STT + voice-engine retry counts for same bug pattern** — Beta.97 reduced `ELEVENLABS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (TTS) from 2 to 1 for the same reason vision retries were capped. Parallel code paths likely have the same latent bug: `ELEVENLABS_STT_RETRY.MAX_ATTEMPTS` in `services/ai-worker/src/services/multimodal/AudioProcessor.ts:28`, and voice-engine retry in `services/ai-worker/src/services/voice/VoiceEngineClient.ts:219` (comment says "matches ElevenLabs retry budget"). Likely need the same 2→1 cut. Not bundled into beta.97 to keep scope tight; folding into follow-up once telemetry shows retry success rates for STT and voice-engine paths. **Adjacent**: when any of these `MAX_ATTEMPTS` values is raised again, add direct unit tests for the relevant `isTransient*Error` classifier before the bump — at `maxAttempts=1` the classifier is dormant (never invoked by `withRetry`), so a silent classification regression wouldn't fail any current test (`services/ai-worker/src/jobs/handlers/pipeline/steps/TTSStep.ts` `isTransientElevenLabsError` is the specific case flagged in PR #805 review).
- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Investigate Discord user-app integration capabilities** — Tzurot is currently installed as a server-scoped bot. Discord also supports "user app" installations where the bot is scoped to the user and can be invoked anywhere (including servers where the bot isn't installed, DMs, and group DMs). Slash commands already partially work in this form (noticed they can be used in other servers). Investigate: what else does user-app scope unlock? Could it make the bot semi-usable in group DMs? Could it improve 1:1 DM UX? What are the limitations (rate limits, permissions, webhook availability)? Low priority — scoping/scouting only until higher-priority work lands. **Start**: read Discord developer docs on user-install apps, compare feature matrix to our current server-install feature set, identify any UX gains specific to Tzurot's personality-chat model.
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **AI occasionally hallucinating response footer, causing duplication** — Rarely, models (observed with `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free`) hallucinate the "Model: ... / FREE Using free model" footer text into their response content, which then gets the real footer appended on top — resulting in doubled footer lines. Very rare but user-visible. Investigate whether post-processing already strips known footer patterns; if not, add a cleanup step in `ResponsePostProcessor` or the response sender that detects and removes hallucinated footer content before the real footer is appended. Related: the LLM duplicate/looping response detection item may share post-processing infrastructure. **Start**: grep for footer-appending logic (likely in bot-client response sender or ai-worker post-processor), check if any existing stripping handles this pattern.
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **LLM duplicate/looping response detection** — GLM-5 observed producing responses with repeated content blocks (same paragraphs appearing twice within one message). Post-processing should detect and deduplicate repeated paragraph-level blocks. Observed 2026-04-05 with `z-ai/glm-5`. **Start**: `services/ai-worker/src/services/ResponsePostProcessor.ts` — add a deduplication step; `services/ai-worker/src/utils/responseArtifacts.ts` — may fit alongside existing cleanup patterns.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Rate limit `/voice-references/:slug`** — Unauthenticated endpoint serving binary audio from DB. Low urgency (Railway private networking limits exposure).
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Dynamic free model selection from OpenRouter** — Replace hardcoded `FREE_MODELS` / `VISION_FALLBACK_FREE` with a query layer on `OpenRouterModelCache`. Models go stale when sunset. **Start**: `services/api-gateway/src/services/OpenRouterModelCache.ts`.
- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Inspect command privacy toggle** — Per-personality toggle to hide character card details from `/inspect`.
- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Character import — optional voice file support** — Accept optional voice reference audio alongside character data import.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Standardize over-long field handling pattern across commands** — The `/memory` command has a well-designed two-flow pattern for handling content exceeding Discord modal input limits: detection + destructive-action warning + explicit opt-in for edits (`detailModals.ts:61-156`), and a `"View Full"` affordance for reads that renders content without modal constraints (`detail.ts:85-155`). The character edit dashboard is known to have the same class of bug (see 🚨 Production Issue "Character field length caps cause silent data loss...") but currently lacks any warning — `ModalFactory.buildSectionModal` silently truncates via `slice(0, maxLength)`. Other commands with similar potential (personas with long descriptions, presets with long system prompts, etc.) may also be affected but haven't been audited. **Action**: (1) Fix character first as its own PR using memory's pattern directly (reference fix in the Production Issue entry). (2) When a second or third consumer needs the same behavior, extract the pattern into `services/bot-client/src/utils/dashboard/overLongFieldWarning.ts` as a shared utility and migrate memory + character to use it (rule of three). (3) Audit other commands for silent truncation patterns that should also use it. **Start**: `services/bot-client/src/commands/memory/detailModals.ts:61-156` (reference implementation); `services/bot-client/src/commands/{persona,preset,character}/` for additional audit targets; grep for `slice(0, maxLength)` and `setValue` across bot-client commands to find silent-truncate sites.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Add `pnpm ops release:verify-notes` command** — Compares proposed release notes against `git log v<previous-tag>..HEAD --no-merges` to catch duplicate/missing items. The beta.94 release had 4 items duplicated from beta.93 because notes were written from CURRENT.md (session tracker) instead of the actual tag diff. The git-workflow skill now documents the correct process, but a tooling command would enforce it mechanically. **Start**: `packages/tooling/src/commands/release.ts` — add a `verify-notes` subcommand that parses release notes markdown, extracts PR numbers, and cross-checks against the commit range.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Periodic audit of `scripts/` for patterns to promote to `packages/tooling/`** — `scripts/` is documented as a home for one-off data migration / codegen / investigation scripts that run once and are deleted. But over time the category accretes permanent-ish files (current subdirectories: `analysis/`, `data/`, `debug/`, `deployment/`, `migrations/`, `testing/`, `src/db/`, etc.) that suggest some "one-offs" actually repeat. When a pattern has 3+ sibling scripts, it's graduated past "one-off" and should become a `pnpm ops` command with structured options, tests, and doc. Audit rule: when adding a new `scripts/` file, check `scripts/` for sibling files with similar shape; if 3+ exist, promote. Schedule a quarterly audit to catch accreted patterns. The driving example is the DB-survey script added in PR #778's investigation — if a second DB-survey script appears in the next few sessions, it's a clear promotion candidate. Also consider adding this check as a rule in `05-tooling.md`. **Start**: `find scripts/ -name '*.ts'` (NOT `ls scripts/src/**/*.ts` — most existing script subdirectories like `analysis/`, `data/`, `debug/`, `deployment/`, `migrations/`, `testing/` are direct children of `scripts/`, not under `scripts/src/`) to enumerate, group by shape, identify 3+ sibling clusters as promotion candidates.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Improve Railway log search DX for incident digs** — When investigating specific production issues (see the AbortError inbox item above for a live example), the current Railway log surface is painful to search — no easy way to filter by request ID across services, correlate a user-visible symptom with a specific worker job, or scope to a tight time window around a known bad event. Most digs end with "I scrolled through the log stream hoping I'd spot the right line."

  **Investigation (2026-04-13)** — the tooling gap is smaller than BOTH the logging-practice gap AND the initial assessment:
  - **Railway CLI 4.11.2 supports server-side `--filter` with full query syntax** — not just substring matching. Per `railway logs --help`: plain text search (`"error message"`), attribute filters (`@level:error`, `@level:warn`), boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `-` for NOT), and combinations (`"@level:warn AND rate limit"`). Docs: https://docs.railway.com/guides/logs. This is a powerful, server-side query engine already available today.
  - **`pnpm ops logs --filter` is NOT using it**. `packages/tooling/src/deployment/logs.ts:44-68` does client-side substring grep in JS after fetching unfiltered logs via `railway logs -n <lines>`. The wrapper's `--filter` string never reaches the Railway args array at line 227. That's why the wrapper feels less capable than the underlying CLI — because it IS.
  - **Correlation-ID threading is still a real gap**: bot-client logs reliably include both `requestId` and `jobId` (e.g., `commands/character/chat.ts:284`). But api-gateway and ai-worker often log only `jobId`: `api-gateway/src/routes/ai/confirmDelivery.ts:65`, `ai-worker/src/jobs/AIJobProcessor.ts:118`, `ai-worker/src/jobs/ShapesExportJob.ts:111`. Even with full `--filter` support, `railway logs --filter "requestId:X"` finds bot-client lines but fails to stitch them to worker processing — which is exactly the layer where most incidents unfold.
  - **`docs/reference/RAILWAY_CLI_REFERENCE.md`** is accurate on CLI mechanics but its logs section doesn't document the query syntax or `--since`/`--until` usage. Cheap to expand.
  - **`.claude/skills/tzurot-deployment` log-analysis patterns are pre-`--filter`-era** — still show `railway logs | grep` piping. Needs update to match current CLI.
  - **Log-forwarding (Axiom/Loki/Datadog)**: recurring cost, not justified for current incident rate.

  **Remaining work after step 0 promotion** (step 0 → Quick Wins 2026-04-15):
  1. **Thread `requestId` into BullMQ job data** so ai-worker handlers log it alongside `jobId` (~2 hrs). Blocks cross-service correlation with any query tool. Start in `common-types/src/types/queue-types.ts` (job data schema), propagate to api-gateway submit sites and ai-worker job handlers.
  2. **Document the query syntax** in `RAILWAY_CLI_REFERENCE.md` (~30 min) and update the `tzurot-deployment` skill's log-analysis section to use `--filter` patterns instead of `| grep` (~15 min).
  3. **Optional**: add explicit `--request-id` / `--job-id` / `--since` ergonomic flags to `pnpm ops logs` that translate to Railway query syntax (`@requestId:X`) (~2-3 hrs, only valuable after step 1).

- ✨ `[FEAT]` **Cross-channel context slice via message-link range** — Users want to import a specific slice of another channel's history into the current conversation by giving a start and end marker (message ID or message link), not just individual messages. Today the only reliable way to pull other-channel context is to paste a bunch of message links one-by-one and let the reference parser expand each — messy, tedious, and doesn't preserve ordering well for long ranges. Distinct from (though adjacent to) the existing Inbox item "Cross-channel history — smarter retrieval with limits", which is about the LLM-driven auto-retrieval path; this one is explicitly user-driven bulk import of a known range.

  **Investigation (2026-04-13)** — existing infrastructure makes this a small feature, but there's a security prerequisite:
  - **Actual location is `services/bot-client/src/handlers/references/`** (not `utils/messageReferences/` as originally guessed). Clean Parser → Resolver → Formatter architecture: `ReferenceCrawler.ts:46-271` (BFS graph traversal with dedup), `LinkExtractor.ts:20-352` (Discord fetch chain with `10008`/`50001`/`50013` error handling), `MessageFormatter.ts:30-135` (shape into `ReferencedMessage` + voice-transcript append), `ReferenceFormatter.ts:31-183` (sort + number + link replacement).
  - **Strategy pattern already in place**: `handlers/references/strategies/` already has `ReplyReferenceStrategy` and `LinkReferenceStrategy`. A new `MessageRangeStrategy` plugs in as a sibling — no architectural refactor needed. Estimated ~100–150 LOC for the new strategy + a `MessageRangeExtractor` class.
  - **Links are already auto-detected on every message** (not command-gated), via `MessageReferenceExtractor.extractReferencesWithReplacement()` called from `PersonalityMessageHandler.handleMessage()`. There's a 2.5s wait at `MessageReferenceExtractor.ts:128` for Discord embeds to populate as part of the extraction flow.
  - **Existing limits**: `maxReferences` defaults to 10, shares budget with `maxMessages` (default 50, max 100). See `MessageReferenceExtractor.ts:63` and `common-types/constants/message.ts:36`. Range-import should respect the same shared budget, not carve out a separate one.
  - **🔴 CRITICAL security finding — permission check is bot-only, not user-scoped**: `LinkExtractor.fetchMessageFromLink()` (lines 124-251) fetches via `sourceMessage.client` (the bot's own Discord credentials). It verifies the bot has access; it does NOT verify the invoking user has access to the source channel. This is already a live info-leak vector in single-link expansion — see new Inbox item "Cross-channel reference expansion may leak messages across permission boundaries" below. **A range-import feature would inherit and amplify this (1 link → N messages).** Fixing the permission check is a hard prerequisite for safely shipping range-import.

  **Start (when a session picks this up)**: fix `LinkExtractor.fetchMessageFromLink()` user-permission check first (see related Inbox item); then create `handlers/references/strategies/MessageRangeStrategy.ts` + `MessageRangeExtractor.ts`; plug into `ReferenceCrawler.ts` alongside the existing strategies. Command home: `/history range` or `/channel import-range` are natural candidates — both existing namespaces. Design open question: how does the user express the range — slash options, pasted `link1...link2` syntax auto-detected, or a modal with two fields?

- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Extract `TimeoutError` + `normalizeErrorForLogging` to `@tzurot/common-types/errors`** — `TimeoutError` is defined at `services/ai-worker/src/utils/retry.ts:79-89` and is the canonical sentinel for "we wrapped something with our own timeout and it fired." ai-worker callers use it correctly via import (`VoiceEngineClient.ts`, `AudioProcessor.ts`, `ElevenLabsClient.ts`, `KeyValidationService.ts`). But `services/bot-client/src/utils/userGatewayClient.ts:132` does stringly-typed detection — `error instanceof DOMException && error.name === 'TimeoutError'` — instead of importing the sentinel. That's a re-invention and is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase. Same architectural gap for `normalizeErrorForLogging` (handles LangChain's "throws plain `{}`" case) at `retry.ts:101-117`: ai-worker-only today, would benefit api-gateway and bot-client in principle even though neither currently calls LangChain. Extract both into a new `packages/common-types/src/errors.ts` module and migrate consumers to import from there. Surfaced during 2026-04-14 error-handling architecture audit ("partially unified with gaps in bot-client"). **Start**: `services/ai-worker/src/utils/retry.ts:79-89` (TimeoutError), `retry.ts:101-117` (normalizeErrorForLogging), new home `packages/common-types/src/errors.ts`, consumer to migrate `services/bot-client/src/utils/userGatewayClient.ts:132`.
- 🧹 `[CHORE]` **Tighten `HARDCODED_CONFIG_DEFAULTS.maxAge` from `null` to 7 days globally** — Today the cascaded-config default for history `maxAge` is `null` (no age limit). That means the bot includes messages of arbitrary age in AI context, which surfaces as the AbortError/404 retry storms (old messages more often have expired CDN URLs; see evidence in the AbortError Inbox entry above). Changing the hardcoded default to `604800` (7 days) applies the same policy to all users who haven't set their own override. User's own default is already 7 days. Small change in `packages/common-types/src/schemas/api/configOverrides.ts`, but the discussion is the real work: do we want existing users to feel this change immediately (one-time "history looks shorter" effect for anyone not on the default), or is there a way to migrate gradually? Distinct from a hypothetical `maxImageAge` cascade setting (text stays old, images age out faster) — that's bigger design work and lives as a future `[FEAT]` if we decide the single-setting approach doesn't work. **Start**: `packages/common-types/src/schemas/api/configOverrides.ts` — locate `HARDCODED_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, change `maxAge` from `null` to `604800`; grep consumers to verify `null` vs number semantics are preserved across the cascade resolver.

## 🎯 Current Focus

_This week's active work. Max 3 items._

### Identity & Provisioning Hardening Epic — Phase 5c (next)

Phases 1–5b shipped 2026-04-16 (PRs #803/#807/#808/#814/#816/#817/#818). **Phase 5c** is queued: eliminate the `getOrCreateUserShell` path entirely. It exists because api-gateway HTTP routes only see `discordUserId` in `req.userId`, but the only HTTP client (bot-client) already has the full Discord interaction context at slash-command-handler time. Fix shape: pre-provision via `getOrCreateUser(discordId, username, displayName, bio)` in bot-client before any HTTP call; api-gateway routes switch to `findUserByDiscordIdOrFail` (404 if not provisioned); delete `createShellUserWithRaceProtection`, `buildShellPlaceholderPersonaName`, and the placeholder-rename block in `runMaintenanceTasks`. Council pressure-test first — the API contract for "user must exist" is a middleware-vs-handler design call. **Also fold in**: (a) tighten `User.defaultPersona` relation in Prisma schema from `Persona?` to `Persona` (relation field is stale after Phase 5b made the scalar FK `String` NOT NULL — surfaced in PR #819 review); (b) make `test-utils` import `DEFAULT_PERSONA_DESCRIPTION` (already extracted to `packages/common-types/src/constants/persona.ts` in PR #819) instead of mirroring the literal. Tried during PR #819 review — fails because Turbo's build DAG treats common-types's devDependency on `@tzurot/test-utils` as a build-order edge, and adding common-types as a runtime dep of test-utils creates the inverse edge. Breaking the cycle requires either (i) dropping `@tzurot/test-utils` from common-types's devDependencies and replacing its usage in `.int.test.ts` files with a non-package-dep mechanism (vitest path alias to source, or inlined helpers), or (ii) moving the shared constant(s) into a third standalone package that neither common-types nor test-utils depends on. Both are structural package-graph surgery, which is why they belong in 5c. Both items are type/organization tightenings that pair naturally with the dead-code cleanup 5c enables — after the relation tightens, `PersonaResolver` Priority 3 fallback and the dangling-FK error branches become structurally unreachable and can be deleted too.

After 5c: **Phase 6 — integration test coverage for the refactor-regression class**. Goal: the `c88ae5b7` class of regression fails loudly in tests. End-to-end test exercising "user hits HTTP route → later Discord interaction → system prompt correctness assertion." Estimated ~2 days. Entry point: `docs/reference/architecture/epic-identity-hardening.md § Phase 6`.

### Other in-flight

- ✨ `[FEAT]` **TTS engine upgrade — replace Pocket TTS + add cheaper BYOK alternative** — Current pain: ElevenLabs v3 costs ~$200/month, Pocket TTS quality is inadequate for users. Research (2026-04-12) identified two top candidates:

  **Self-hosted (replace Pocket TTS):**
  - **Chatterbox Turbo** (350M, Resemble AI, MIT) — beats ElevenLabs in 63.75% of blind tests, has native zero-shot voice cloning + emotion control, explicit CPU Docker support, OpenAI-compatible API servers exist. Primary candidate.
  - **Kokoro 82M** (Apache) — #1 TTS Arena, tiny and CPU-optimized, but **no native voice cloning** (needs third-party KokoClone addon). Backup if Chatterbox is too heavy for Railway 4GB.

  **Paid API (cheaper BYOK alternative to ElevenLabs):**
  - **Voxtral API** (Mistral, $16/1M chars vs ElevenLabs ~$60) — 73% cheaper, wins 68% vs EL Flash in human prefs, zero-shot cloning from 3s audio. Open-weight model available as self-host fallback.
  - **Fish Audio** ($15/1M chars) — #1 TTS-Arena, 75% cheaper than ElevenLabs.

  **Next steps:**
  1. Spin up Chatterbox Turbo in a test container (Railway dev or local)
  2. Feed it a character reference audio, compare output vs Pocket TTS vs ElevenLabs
  3. If quality is good, plan the voice-engine integration (swap TTS backend, keep STT as-is)
  4. Evaluate Voxtral API as a BYOK option alongside or replacing ElevenLabs

  **Start**: `services/voice-engine/server.py` (current Pocket TTS integration), Chatterbox Docker: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cpu.yml up -d` from [devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server](https://github.com/devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server). Research links saved in Claude auto-memory (`project_voice_tts_research.md`).

## ⚡️ Quick Wins

_Small tasks that can be done between major features. Good for momentum._

- 🐛 `[FIX]` **Flaky xray analyzer test — "should include suppressions in file data" times out in CI** — `packages/tooling/src/xray/analyzer.test.ts:182` timed out at 15s on CI runner (observed 2026-04-13, run #24367518180). The test calls `analyzeMonorepo` which initializes a `ts-morph` Project — CPU-intensive on resource-constrained CI runners. May have worsened with `ts-morph` 27→28. Fix options: (a) increase timeout for this specific test, (b) mock `ts-morph` Project creation, (c) split suppression parsing from full analysis so it can be tested without the expensive Project init. **Start**: `packages/tooling/src/xray/analyzer.test.ts:182`, `packages/tooling/src/xray/analyzer.ts` (analyzeMonorepo function).
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **Preset save errors are opaque — context-too-large surfaces as "failed to save"** — When a vendor restricts context on an existing model (e.g., z.ai dropping GLM context limits when releasing newer models — observed dropping to 40k–80k), editing an existing preset whose `maxContextTokens` was set to the old higher value fails with a generic "failed to save" message. User has to read Railway logs to discover the real cause. The vendor's 4xx error needs to be parsed and surfaced to the user with actionable wording (e.g., "This model's context limit is now N tokens — please reduce maxContextTokens before saving"). **Start**: preset save endpoint in `api-gateway` (search for the route handler); upstream LLM provider error mapping needs context-limit detection. Likely a missed branch in the existing error-to-user-message translation.
- 🐛 `[FIX]` **Preset clone fails on name collision instead of auto-numbering** — Cloning a preset that's already a copy fails with "a copy already exists." Other clone flows in the codebase appear to handle this by auto-numbering (e.g., "Foo (2)", "Foo (3)") but presets don't. Should be standardized — every clone button should resolve name collisions the same way. **Start**: grep for clone/copy handlers in `services/bot-client/src/commands/{personality,character,persona,preset}/` — find the existing auto-number pattern (if any) and either reuse or extract into a shared helper. If no existing pattern: create one and apply to all clone flows. Related: consider whether this also surfaces clone affordances inconsistently across commands.
- 🏗️ `[LIFT]` **Collapse `PersonaResolver.getFocusModeStatus` two-query hop into one** — `packages/common-types/src/services/resolvers/PersonaResolver.ts:138-171` runs two sequential Prisma queries on every focus-mode check: `user.findUnique` by `discordId` to get `user.id`, then `userPersonalityConfig.findFirst` by `userId + personalityId`. The user lookup is redundant — the query can collapse to one using a nested `user: { discordId }` filter: `prisma.userPersonalityConfig.findFirst({ where: { user: { discordId: discordUserId }, personalityId }, select: { configOverrides: true } })`. Not urgent (focus mode is checked at most once per `resolveForContext` call) but `resolveForContext` is deep in the hot path. Estimated ~10 LOC change plus a test update. **Surfaced by**: claude-bot review R3 on PR #819. **Start**: `packages/common-types/src/services/resolvers/PersonaResolver.ts:138`.

### 🐛 Detect and Retry Inadequate LLM Responses

LLMs occasionally return a 200 OK with garbage content — e.g., glm-5 returned just `"N" (1 token, finishReason: "unknown"`, 160s duration). Needs compound scoring heuristic + timing data threading through RAGResponse. ~4-6hr feature, not a quick win — moved details to Logging & Error Observability theme.

## 🏗 Active Epic: Identity & Provisioning Hardening

_Focus: eliminate the structural conditions that let the persona-snowflake bug ship undetected for 4 months. Seven numbered phases, two remaining (5c, 6)._

**Status**: Phases 1–5b all shipped by 2026-04-16. Phase 1 (PR #803, beta.97) tactical heal. Phase 2 (PRs #807/#808, beta.98) provisioning choke point. Phase 3 (PR #814, unreleased) read-only PersonaResolver. Phase 4 (PR #816, unreleased) killed discord:XXXX format. Phase 5 (PR #817, unreleased) DB-level invariants. Phase 5b (PR #818, unreleased) NOT NULL default_persona_id via single-statement CTE bootstrap + backfillDefaultPersona deletion.

**Full epic doc**: `docs/reference/architecture/epic-identity-hardening.md` — phase scopes, decision records (D1–D6), cross-cutting principles.

**Remaining phases**:

- **Phase 5c**: eliminate the shell-creation path entirely. `getOrCreateUserShell` exists because api-gateway HTTP routes only receive `discordUserId` in `req.userId` — no username/displayName/bio context. But the only HTTP client is bot-client, which DOES have the full interaction context at slash-command-handler time. Fix shape: bot-client pre-provisions via `getOrCreateUser(discordId, username, displayName, bio)` before any slash-command → HTTP call; api-gateway routes switch to `findUserByDiscordIdOrFail` (404 if not provisioned — invariant: bot-client provisions first); delete `createShellUserWithRaceProtection`, `buildShellPlaceholderPersonaName`, and the placeholder-persona rename block in `runMaintenanceTasks`. ~13 HTTP routes touched + ~20 slash-command handlers audited for pre-provision. Council pressure-test before implementation — API-contract design question (middleware vs. per-handler vs. auth extension) needs explicit choice. ~200–400 LOC net delete once the cutover lands. **Also closes a known gap** flagged in PR #818 R4 review: the placeholder-rename block in `runMaintenanceTasks` is two separate writes (`user.update` + `persona.updateMany`) with no transaction, so a crash between them leaves the user with the real username but the persona stuck on `"User {discordId}"` — and the `user.username === discordId` guard never retries. 5c removes the block entirely, so the atomicity question disappears rather than needing its own fix.
- **Phase 6**: integration test coverage for the refactor-regression class (would have caught `c88ae5b7`). ~2 days.

**Cross-cutting principle**: council pressure-test BEFORE each phase starts, not mid-implementation. ADR when an architectural choice is made. (Phases 3, 4, 5 all validated this principle — council reframes consistently shrank or correctly-scoped each phase.)

---

## 📅 Next Epic: CPD Clone Reduction

_Focus: Reduce code clones to <100. Paused for Identity Hardening; resume after Phase 6._

**Progress**: 175 → 127 (PRs #599, #665–#668); grew to 152 from features; PR #729 → 146; 2026-04-06 architecture day (PRs #766, #768, #769) → 137; PR #776 (browse footer helpers) → 126; Session 1 (PRs #778, #779) → 118; PR #785 (ElevenLabs `readBody` extraction) → 119; 2026-04-13 quick wins session (PRs #794-798, thinking tags data-driven, BrowseActionRow extraction, routeHelpers split) → 119. **Current (`develop`): 119.** BrowseActionRow and thinking tag dedup were type/regex clones not counted by CPD; runtime code clone count unchanged.

### Completed (Phases 1-4)

Phases 1-4 shipped in PRs #599, #665-#668, #704 — Redis setup factory, error reply helpers, route test utilities, personality formatters, API gateway route boilerplate extractions. See git history for details.

### Phase 5: Bot-Client Dashboard Patterns (~16 clones)

Session/ownership boilerplate and modal/select handling repeated across all dashboard commands.

- [ ] Standardize `requireDashboardSession` utility — session lookup + expiry + ownership check (8 clones across settings, preset, persona, deny dashboards)
- [ ] Extract `handleDashboardModalSubmit` — section lookup + value extraction + API call + refresh (4 clones)
- [ ] Extract `handleDashboardSelectMenu` — edit prefix parsing + section lookup (2 clones)
- [ ] Deduplicate persona profile section config — single source of truth between `config.ts` and `profileSections.ts` (3 clones)

### Phase 6: Bot-Client Command Patterns (~15 clones)

Subcommand routing, browse/pagination, custom IDs, and command-specific duplication.

- [ ] Consolidate subcommand routers — parameterized router with context-type generic (3 clones)
- [x] Migrate browse consumers to `browse/` utilities, delete `paginationBuilder.ts` (4 clones) — PRs #771-776
- [x] Servers command: use `createBrowseCustomIdHelpers` instead of inline parsing (4 clones) — PR #773
- [ ] Extract memory command shared helpers — `formatMemoryLine` (remaining clones)

### Phase 7: Cross-Service & Common-Types (~15 clones)

Shared types, config resolver patterns, and remaining cross-service duplication.

- [x] Define `PersonalityFields` type in common-types — `PersonalityCharacterFields` interface + Zod schema fragment (4 files updated)
- [ ] Extract `CacheWithTTL` base — cleanup interval + user-prefix invalidation (6 clones across config resolvers)
- [x] DRY personality create/update Zod schemas — use `.extend()` (2 clones) — already implemented via `...PersonalityCharacterFieldsSchema.shape` composition in `PersonalityCreateSchema` and `PersonalityUpdateSchema` (confirmed during Session 1 investigation, 2026-04-11)
- [ ] Extract `sessionContextFields` Zod fragment — shared between jobs.ts and personality schemas (1 clone)
- [ ] ResultsListener: use shared `createIORedisClient` factory (1 clone)

### Phase 8: AI Worker + Tooling (~10 clones)

Smaller wins in ai-worker internal patterns and tooling utilities.

- [ ] Extract `createStuckJobCleanup(model, config)` factory (2 clones)
- [x] Extract `handleShapesJobError` shared error handler — `shapesJobHelpers.ts` factory with callbacks
- [ ] Extract tooling `spawnWithPiping` and shared `execFileSafe` helpers (3 clones)
- [ ] Extract migration preamble helper (`validateEnvironment` + banner + client) (2 clones)

### Remaining (~10 clones)

Small, localized duplication (1-2 clones each) across deny commands, shapes formatters, preset import types, autocomplete error handling, avatar file ops. Fix opportunistically.

**Target**: <100 clones or <1.5%. Currently 119 clones on develop.

### Theme: Package Extraction

_Focus: Reduce common-types export bloat and split bot-client, the largest package. Demoted from Next Epic 2026-04-15 when Identity Hardening promoted; resume after CPD Clone Reduction completes._

**Codebase snapshot (2026-02-12)**: 108K hand-written production LOC + 45K Prisma-generated.

| Package      | Files | LOC | Exports | Status                                                                              |
| ------------ | ----- | --- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bot-client   | 254   | 46K | 767     | **Outlier** — nearly half the codebase, primary extraction target                   |
| ai-worker    | 105   | 19K | —       | Healthy                                                                             |
| api-gateway  | 104   | 17K | —       | Healthy                                                                             |
| common-types | 99    | 16K | 607     | LOC is fine (45K "bloat" was Prisma-generated); **607 exports** is the real problem |
| tooling      | 61    | 9K  | —       | Fine                                                                                |

#### Phase 1: Assessment

- [ ] Reassess common-types export count — categorize exports by domain to identify extraction boundaries
- [ ] Profile bot-client's 46K lines — which subdirectories are self-contained?
- [ ] Reference: PR #558 analysis

#### Phase 2: Extraction

- [ ] Candidates: `@tzurot/discord-dashboard` (30 files, self-contained), `@tzurot/message-references` (12 files), `@tzurot/discord-command-context` (6 files)
- [ ] Re-evaluate whether common-types needs splitting or just export pruning

**Previous work**: Architecture Health epic (PRs #593–#597) completed dead code purge, oversized file splits, 400-line max-lines limit, and circular dependency resolution (54→25, all remaining are generated Prisma code).

### Theme: Memory System Overhaul

_Dependency chain: Configuration Consolidation → LTM Summarization → Table Migration → OpenMemory_

#### 1. ✨ LTM Summarization (Shapes.inc Style)

Verbatim conversation storage is redundant with extended context. Replace with LLM-generated summaries.

- [ ] Configurable grouping (5, 10, 50 messages or 1h, 4h, 24h time windows)
- [ ] Separate LLM call for summarization (fast/cheap model)
- [ ] Store summaries as LTM instead of verbatim turns

#### 2. 🏗️ Memories Table Migration

Two formats coexist (shapes.inc imports vs tzurot-v3 verbatim). Need unified format.

- [ ] Design unified memory format (draw from both sources)
- [ ] One-time migration of existing tzurot-v3 memories
- [ ] Run existing verbatim memories through summarizer

#### 3. 🏗️ OpenMemory Migration

Waypoint graph architecture with multi-sector storage.

- [ ] Design waypoint graph schema
- [ ] Migration path from current flat memories
- [ ] See `docs/proposals/backlog/OPENMEMORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

#### 🏗️ Per-User Quotas

No limits on memories per persona. Add `maxMemoriesPerPersona` (default: 10,000).

#### 🏗️ Contrastive Retrieval for RAG

Improve memory retrieval quality with contrastive methods.

#### ✨ Cross-channel history — smarter retrieval with limits

Limit messages per channel, prioritize channels with active conversations. Distinct from the user-driven `/history range` import (tracked in Inbox) — this one is about the automatic retrieval path that assembles context at generation time.

---

### Theme: Character Portability

_Import and export characters and user data. Users own their data._

#### ✨ User Data Export

Unified export of all user-owned data. Currently preset export and character export exist but are separate.

- [ ] `/persona export` command - download all user data as JSON/ZIP
- [ ] Include: personas, presets, LLM configs, memories, conversation history
- [ ] Include: user settings, timezone, API keys (masked)
- [ ] Consider: character cards (PNG with embedded metadata) for personalities
- [ ] Privacy: only export data the user owns or has created

**Existing partial implementations**: `/preset export`, `/character export`

#### ✨ Character Card Import

Import V2/V3 character cards (PNG with embedded metadata). SillyTavern compatibility.

- [ ] Parse PNG metadata (V2 JSON in tEXt chunk, V3 in separate format)
- [ ] Map character card fields to v3 personality schema
- [ ] `/character import` support for PNG files

#### ✨ Shapes.inc Import

Phases 1-4 shipped (PRs #593-#662): schema, data fetcher, import pipeline, `/shapes` commands. Remaining backlogged phases:

- [ ] Phase 5: Sidecar prompt injection (depends on "User System Prompts" feature)
- [ ] Phase 6: Voice/image field import (voice tracked in Voice Engine Phase 5; image deferred)
- [ ] Phase 7: Training data import (needs training data schema first)
- [ ] Phase 8: Resolve memory sender UUIDs to display names via shapes.inc API
- [ ] Phase 9: Configurable export sections (`include_config`, `include_memories`, etc.)

---

### Theme: User-Requested Features

_Features requested by actual users. High value._

#### ✨ Multi-Personality Per Channel

Allow multiple personalities active in a single channel.

- [ ] Track multiple active personalities per channel
- [ ] Natural order speaker selection (who responds next)
- [ ] Handle @mentions when multiple personalities present
- [ ] `/channel add-personality` and `/channel remove-personality` commands

#### ✨ User System Prompts (Sidecar Prompts)

Per-user text injected into the system message, shaping how characters interact with that specific user. Shapes.inc calls this "user personalization" — a freeform backstory (~3KB) the user writes about themselves per character. During shapes.inc import, this data is preserved in `customFields.sidecarPrompt` JSONB.

- [ ] Add `sidecarPrompt` field to `UserPersonalityConfig` (per-user-per-character) or `User` (global)
- [ ] Prompt assembly: inject sidecar text into system message (after character profile, before conversation)
- [ ] `/persona` dashboard upgrade to edit sidecar prompt
- [ ] Migration: move shapes.inc imported `customFields.sidecarPrompt` to proper field

#### ✨ Channel Allowlist/Denylist

Prevents bot from spamming unwanted channels, reduces server kicks.

- [ ] Add `mode` (allowlist/denylist) and `channels` array to ChannelSettings
- [ ] `/channel restrict` command for server admins
- [ ] Middleware check in message handler
- [ ] Consider "Ghost Mode" - bot listens but only replies when pinged

#### ✨ Multi-Character Invocation Per Message

Support tagging multiple characters in one message, each responding in order.

**Example**: `@character1 @character2 hello both` → both respond sequentially

- [ ] Modify mention extraction to return array of all valid mentions
- [ ] Combine reply target + mentions into ordered list (reply first, then mentions L→R)
- [ ] Add max limit (3-4 characters per message) to prevent abuse

#### ✨ Emoji Reaction Actions

Allow emoji reactions to trigger personality actions.

- [ ] Define action mapping (❤️ = positive feedback, 👎 = regenerate, etc.)
- [ ] Hook into reaction events (reactionAdd handler)
- [ ] Action dispatch based on emoji → action mapping

#### ✨ Denylist Duration Support

Allow `/deny` entries to have an optional expiration for temporary bans (e.g., `duration:24h`). Requires `expiresAt` column, filter check, and BullMQ cleanup job.

#### ✨ Transcript Spoiler Word List

Admin-managed list of words to auto-spoiler in voice transcripts (`||word||`). Add `spoilerWords` string array to `AdminSettings` JSONB with case-insensitive word-boundary matching.

#### ✨ Discord Emoji/Sticker Image Support

Support custom Discord emoji and stickers in vision context. Extract emoji URLs from `<:name:id>` format, sticker URLs from message stickers, include alongside attachments.

---

### Theme: Model Configuration Overhaul

_Redesign how models are configured. Bundle paid/free/vision into reusable profiles._

#### ✨ Config cascade extension — server, user-server, user-channel tiers

Current cascade: admin < personality < channel < user-default < user+personality. Missing tiers:

- **Server-level defaults** (server admins can set channel-scoped-to-guild defaults)
- **User-channel** (per-user per-channel, e.g., "1 week maxAge globally but off in #general")

User-default overriding channel is by design but limits power-user flexibility. Significant refactor — likely bundled with LLM Config Profiles since both change cascade shape.

#### ✨ LLM Config Profiles (Meta Configs)

Current LlmConfig is a single model. Redesign as **profiles** that bundle paid + free models together, so the system can auto-fallback and users pick a profile rather than individual models.

**Core concept**: A profile is a named container with a description/purpose (e.g., "General Purpose", "NSFW", "Coding") that holds:

- Paid model config (model, temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Free model config (fallback when quota/billing isn't available)
- Vision model config (bundled in — changing the global vision model should be one action, not per-LlmConfig)

**Cascade integration**: Profiles apply at all 4 config cascade levels — admin global default, personality default, user global default, user-personality override. Vision model inherits from the profile by default but users can override at any tier.

**User-facing**:

- Admin creates global profiles (themed defaults everyone can use)
- Users can create their own profiles (global/non-global, like personalities)
- `/preset` system may merge into or coexist with this

**Open questions**:

- Relationship to existing `Preset` system — replace, merge, or layer on top?
- How many vision profile themes are actually needed? (general, NSFW, document — or just general + NSFW)
- Character-level free model default (does it exist today? needs investigation)

#### ✨ Free Model Quota Resilience

Automatic fallback to alternative free model on 402 quota errors. Track quota hits per model to avoid repeated failures. Foundation shipped in PR #587.

#### 🏗️ Vision Model as Full LLM Config

Currently vision model is just a model name string. Promote to a full `LlmConfig` reference (temperature, max tokens, system prompt, etc.) — but exclude the `visionModel` field itself (no recursive vision config). Likely folded into profiles above.

### Theme: Next-Gen AI Capabilities

_Future features: agentic behavior, multi-modality, advanced prompts._

#### Advanced Prompt Features

_SillyTavern-inspired prompt engineering._

- **Lorebooks / Sticky Context** - Keyword-triggered lore injection with TTL
- **Author's Note Depth Injection** - Insert notes at configurable depth in conversation
- **Dynamic Directive Injection** - Anti-sycophancy prompt techniques

#### Agentic Features

_Self-directed personality behaviors._

- **Agentic Scaffolding** - Think → Act → Observe loop
- **Dream Sequences** - Self-reflection and memory consolidation
- **Relationship Graphs** - Track relationships between users and personalities

#### Multi-Modality

_Beyond text: voice and images._

- **Image Generation** - AI-generated images from personalities

---

### Theme: Voice Engine

_Focus: Two-tier voice system (self-hosted free + ElevenLabs BYOK premium) for both STT and TTS._

**Status**: Phases 1–4.6 shipped. Free tier (Parakeet TDT + Pocket TTS) in v3.0.0-beta.89. ElevenLabs BYOK (Phase 4) in PR #727. Configurable TTS model + cleanup (Phase 4.6) in PR #729. Dev-testing fixes (scoped-key detection, voice auto-reclone, STT userId) in v3.0.0-beta.90.

| Tier               | STT                         | TTS               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Free (self-hosted) | NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 | Kyutai Pocket TTS |
| Premium (BYOK)     | ElevenLabs Scribe v2        | ElevenLabs v3     |

#### Phases 1-4.6 (COMPLETE)

All shipped across beta.89-90 + PRs #710, #727, #729, #731-733. Key milestones:

- **Phase 1**: Python FastAPI voice-engine service (Parakeet TDT STT + Pocket TTS), Railway Serverless
- **Phase 2**: ai-worker VoiceEngineClient integration, replaced Whisper STT
- **Phase 3/3b**: TTS pipeline (TTSStep, chunked synthesis, Redis audio storage), `/character voice` command, config cascade wiring
- **Phase 4/4.5**: ElevenLabs BYOK (TTS, STT, voice cloning, slot management), Whisper removal
- **Phase 4.6**: Configurable TTS model (`/settings voices model`), CPD cleanup (152→146)

See git history for detailed task lists.

#### Phase 5: Shapes.inc Voice Field Import

Import voice configuration from shapes.inc character data.

- [ ] Map shapes.inc `voice_model`, `voice_id`, `voice_stability` fields to Tzurot voice config
- [ ] Set `voiceEnabled: true` for imported characters with voice data
- [ ] Create voice states from imported reference audio if available

**Research**: `docs/research/voice-cloning-2026.md`

#### 🐛 Voice Pipeline Resilience (Cold Start + Timeout Architecture)

Intermittent failures from Railway Serverless cold starts (~56s). Significant progress made in beta.92 and beta.93 work:

**Completed:**

- [x] STT bot-client timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout(120s)`) — PR #757
- [x] Adaptive TTS timeout (150s ElevenLabs, 240s voice-engine) — PR #757
- [x] Warmup polling returns `{ ready, elapsedMs }` for observability — PR #757
- [x] Timeout-aware user error messages — PR #757
- [x] ECONNREFUSED retry resilience for both TTS and STT — PR #759

**Remaining:**

- [ ] Parallel TTS chunking — synthesize chunks concurrently instead of sequentially (long messages still bottleneck)
- [ ] Better user feedback during STT wait — "Transcription in progress..." → "Taking longer than expected..." → error
- [ ] Transcription retry outcome surfacing — user sees generic error, not retry status

### Theme: Logging & Error Observability

_Comprehensive audit of logging quality, error serialization, and log hygiene across the stack._

#### 🐛 Error Serialization Audit

During the GLM-5 empty response investigation, `err` serialized as `{_nonErrorObject: true, raw: "{}"}` despite being a real `Error`. Makes logs nearly useless for debugging provider issues.

- [ ] Audit LangChain throwing non-Error objects that look like Errors
- [ ] Audit Node `undici` fetch errors — `TypeError` from `fetch()` serializes as `raw: "{}"` in Pino (non-enumerable properties). Seen in `GatewayClient.submitJob()` and `PersonalityMessageHandler` on Railway dev (2026-02-15)
- [ ] Review `normalizeErrorForLogging()` in `retry.ts` wrapping behavior
- [ ] Review `determineErrorType()` in `logger.ts` checking `constructor.name`
- [ ] Codebase-wide scan for `{ err: ... }` patterns that produce useless output
- [ ] Goal: every `{ err: ... }` log shows message + stack, never `raw: "{}"`

#### 🐛 Inadequate LLM Response Detection

Compound scoring heuristic to detect garbage 200 OK responses (e.g., glm-5 returned just `"N"`, 1 token, `finishReason: "unknown"`, 160s). All signals already collected by `DiagnosticCollector` but timing data needs threading through `RAGResponse`. Integrates into PR #702's retry loop via `FallbackResponse` ranking.

**Signals**: `finishReason` unknown/error (+0.4), `completionTokens` ≤1/≤5 (+0.3/+0.15), no stop sequence + short (+0.2), extreme ms-per-token (+0.2), empty content (+0.3). Threshold: ≥0.5. Max 1 content retry.

**Files**: `ConversationalRAGTypes.ts` (add timing field), `ConversationalRAGService.ts` (thread timing), `RetryDecisionHelper.ts` or new scorer, `GenerationStep.ts` (call scorer), tests.

**Reference**: `debug/debug-compact-736e6c99-*.json`

#### 🏗️ Per-Attempt Diagnostic Tracking in Retry Loop

When the fallback response path is used (PR #672), the diagnostic payload has data from attempt 1 (token counts, model, raw content) but `llmInvocationMs: undefined` because timing was reset for attempt 2 which failed. Add a `diagnosticAttempt` field or per-attempt timing array so the payload is internally consistent about which attempt's data it contains.

#### 🧹 Logging Verbosity Audit

Some operations log at INFO when they should be DEBUG. Noisy logs obscure real issues in production.

- [ ] Audit all `logger.info()` calls — demote routine operations to DEBUG
- [ ] Ensure ERROR/WARN are reserved for actionable items
- [ ] Review hot paths (message processing, cache lookups) for excessive logging

#### 🏗️ Consistent Service Prefix Injection

Auto-inject `[ServiceName]` prefix in logs instead of hardcoding in every log call.

- [ ] Extend Pino logger factory to auto-add service name prefix
- [ ] Remove manual `[ServiceName]` prefixes from log messages
- [ ] Consider structured `service` field instead of string prefix

#### 🏗️ Audit Error Sanitization in Log Pipeline

Two gaps: (1) Enumerable Error properties (e.g. Axios `error.config.url`) bypass `sanitizeObject()` early-return for `instanceof Error`. (2) `getErrorContext` callback results spread into log objects without sanitization. Check OpenRouter/LangChain error objects, document API contract. Discovered during PR #700.

#### ✨ Admin/User Error Context Differentiation

Admin errors should show full technical context; user errors show sanitized version. Partially done in PR #587 (error display framework shipped), this is the remaining differentiation.

- [ ] Admin error responses include stack traces and internal context
- [ ] User-facing errors show friendly messages without internals

---

### Theme: Observability & Tooling

_Backend health: monitoring, debugging, developer experience._

#### 🏗️ Metrics & Monitoring (Prometheus)

Production observability with metrics collection.

- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] Key metrics: request latency, token usage, error rates, queue depth

#### 🏗️ Database-Configurable Model Capabilities

Move hardcoded model patterns to database for admin updates without deployment.

#### 🏗️ Graduate Warnings to Errors (CI Strictness Ratchet)

Pre-push hook runs CPD and depcruise in warning-only mode (non-blocking). ESLint has warnings for complexity/statements that don't block CI. As we hit targets, tighten the ratchet:

- [ ] **CPD**: Currently non-blocking in pre-push. Once under target (<100 clones), add threshold check that blocks push
- [ ] **Duplicate Exports**: `guard:duplicate-exports` runs in CI with `continue-on-error: true`. Add ratchet (baseline count file + "new duplicates above baseline" check) so it blocks CI while still allowing existing allowlisted duplicates. Then drop `continue-on-error`
- [ ] **ESLint warnings**: `max-statements`, `complexity`, `max-lines-per-function` are warn-level. Audit current violation count, set a baseline, block new violations
- [ ] **Knip**: Dead code detection runs manually. Add to pre-push or CI as blocking check

Goal: every quality check that currently warns should eventually block, with a clear baseline so new violations are caught immediately.

#### 🏗️ Schema-Type Unification (Zod `z.infer`)

Adopt `z.infer<typeof schema>` across all job types to eliminate manual interface/schema sync. Currently each job type has both a Zod schema and a hand-written TypeScript interface that must be kept in sync manually.

- [ ] Replace `ShapesImportJobData` / `ShapesImportJobResult` interfaces with `z.infer<>` derivations
- [ ] Do the same for `AudioTranscriptionJobData`, `ImageDescriptionJobData`, `LLMGenerationJobData`
- [ ] Consider discriminated unions for success/failure result types (compile-time enforcement that `personalityId` is required on success, `error` is required on failure)
- [ ] Audit all Zod schemas in common-types for interface/schema drift

**Context**: PR #651 added Zod schemas for shapes import jobs and an enforcement test that catches missing schemas. This follow-up eliminates the remaining duplication.

#### 🏗️ Investigate Safe Auto-Migration on Railway

Prisma migrations are currently manual post-deploy (`pnpm ops db:migrate --env dev/prod`). This caused a P2002 bug when a migration was deployed as code but never applied. Investigate: dev-only auto-migration in start command, pre-deploy hook with `prisma migrate deploy`, CI step that validates migration state matches schema.

#### 🏗️ API Gateway Middleware Wiring Integration Tests

Add supertest-style integration tests that boot the actual Express app with real middleware. Verifies auth middleware is correctly applied (factory functions called, not just passed), routes respond properly, error middleware works. Audit `router.use(...)` calls for missing `()` on factory functions. Discovered during PR #691.

#### 🧹 Ops CLI Command Migration

Migrate stub commands to proper TypeScript implementations.

### Theme: Observability & Analytics

_Codebase-wide decisions on retry counts, timeouts, cache TTLs, rate limits, and feature adoption currently rely on guesswork because we don't systematically capture the data needed to answer them. Vision-pipeline telemetry landed 2026-04-14 as the first concrete step; treat the rest as epic-sized work._

#### ✨ Observability & Telemetry Strategy

**Problem**: System-health decisions (retry counts, timeouts, cache TTLs, queue concurrency) are made without quantitative data. Same pattern exists throughout ai-worker, api-gateway, bot-client — vision-pipeline fix on 2026-04-14 was just the first concrete instance.

**Scope**:

- Audit current logging across all services, identify gap events (hot-path successes with `durationMs`, cache hit/miss rates, job durations, queue depths, retry success rates per category)
- Establish `{ durationMs, attempt, errorCategory, ...dimensionX }` structured-log conventions across the codebase (vision-pipeline retry logs are the prototype)
- Document Railway query cookbook (builds on `pnpm ops logs --filter` DSL passthrough)
- Define "decision-triggering metrics" — events that, when queried, answer a specific tuning question

**Non-goal**: standing up Prometheus/Datadog/OTel. Pino + structured logs + Railway server-side query DSL is likely sufficient at one-person-project scale.

#### ✨ User Analytics Strategy

**Problem**: No systematic view of product usage. Questions unanswerable today: which personalities have active users? Are users adopting `/browse` or falling back to `/list`? Does voice-engine adoption correlate with specific personalities? What's retention look like by user cohort?

**Scope**:

- Event taxonomy: command invocations, personality switches, voice/vision/memory usage, user-facing errors (as product signals, not debug signals)
- Privacy constraints: opaque user IDs only — never usernames, message content, or PII
- **Build-vs-buy decision** (first real decision point for this epic):
  - Off-the-shelf leading candidate: **PostHog self-hosted on Railway** (open-source, product-analytics-native, supports server-side event ingestion, self-hostable to avoid third-party data)
  - Lighter alternatives: Plausible (too web-page-centric for a Discord bot), custom Postgres event table + query UI (most control, heaviest ops burden)
- Integration surface: event emission as middleware/hooks in command handlers and job processors, decoupled from business logic

**Non-goal**: anything requiring message-content inspection (privacy non-starter).

---

## 🧊 Icebox

_Ideas for later. Resist the shiny object._

### v2 Parity (Low Priority)

_Eventually kill v2, but these are rarely used features._

- **Personality Aliases** - User-managed alternative names for personalities. v2 had: multi-word aliases (1-4 words, longest-match priority), smart collision handling (append name parts, then random suffix), auto-alias creation from display names, and alias reassignment between personalities. Single-level indirection only (alias → personality ID, no chains). v3 already has `PersonalityAlias` model in schema.
- **Rate Limiting** - Token bucket rate limiting
- **PluralKit Proxy Support** - Support PluralKit proxied messages

### Latent (relevant only if specific triggers fire)

#### 🏗️ Singleton-hazard guard for `UserService` cache

Relevant only if `UserService` is ever refactored from per-request instantiation to a singleton (a reasonable perf improvement).

`UserService.getOrCreateUserShell` intentionally does NOT write to `this.userCache` to prevent a subtle bug: in a singleton context, a shell call would cache a `discordId → userId` mapping, causing subsequent `getOrCreateUser` calls to short-circuit out of the cache and skip `runMaintenanceTasks` (username upgrade + persona backfill). Today's per-request instantiation keeps the cache cold, so this is latent.

Hazard is documented in the cache field's JSDoc (`packages/common-types/src/services/UserService.ts`). Options if UserService is made a singleton: (a) split the caches so shell and full have separate tracking; (b) move username upgrade/persona backfill out of the hot-path into an explicit "ensure provisioned" method callers invoke. Flagged by PR #805 review.

#### 🐛 Voice engine (Pocket TTS) intermittent failures

_Superseded by TTS engine upgrade epic in Current Focus._ Pocket TTS is being replaced by Chatterbox Turbo (research done 2026-04-12, evaluation in progress). Any fix to Pocket TTS would be throwaway work once the replacement ships. Revisit only if the TTS epic stalls for multi-session reasons.

### Infrastructure Debt (Do Opportunistically)

#### 🏗️ Reasoning/Thinking Modernization

Partially done: migrated from `include_reasoning` to modern `reasoning` param via `modelKwargs`. But the custom fetch wrapper in `ModelFactory.ts` that intercepts raw OpenRouter HTTP responses and injects `<reasoning>` tags is still fragile — LangChain's Chat Completions converter silently drops `reasoning` fields, so we intercept before it parses. Needs a cleaner approach (e.g., native Responses API support from OpenRouter, or a LangChain plugin).

**Full details**: `~/.claude/plans/tender-tinkering-stonebraker.md` (Phase 4)

#### 🏗️ Prompt Caching (Anthropic)

Add `cache_control` breakpoints to static prompt sections (character profile, response protocol) for Anthropic models via OpenRouter. Deferred Phase 4 from the XML prompt restructure.

#### 🏗️ Streaming Responses

Stream LLM responses to Discord for better UX on long generations.

#### 🏗️ File Naming Convention Audit

Inconsistent casing between services. Low value / high effort.

#### 🏗️ Incognito Mode - Parallel API Calls

Status command fires up to 100 parallel API calls. Have API return names with sessions.

#### 🏗️ Platform Abstraction Layer — decouple UX from Discord

**Origin (stream of consciousness, 2026-04-13)**: what if there were a translation layer between _the user interactions I want_ and _what Discord slash commands actually look like_? Framed two ways:

1. **Portability hedge**: Discord may stop being a viable platform at some point, and we don't want to be caught flat-footed. A layer that encodes "what experience do I want users to have" separately from "how does Discord express that" would make retargeting to Stoat (née Revolt), a web UI, or any other arbitrary platform a matter of writing a new adapter rather than rewriting every command.
2. **Near-term DX**: a standardized DSL for building slash commands quickly and easily — on top of (and in the same spirit as) the ongoing CPD reduction / duplication cleanup. Instead of each command hand-rolling a `SlashCommandBuilder` tree + bespoke option parsing + bespoke handler wiring, a small in-house builder describes "a command with these options and this intent," and generators produce the Discord registration, the dispatch, and (eventually) any alternate-platform adapter.

**Why it's in Icebox and not deleted**: (a) the CPD reduction work (subcommand router consolidation, browse helpers, dashboard session/modal utilities) is already pushing toward this shape without anyone asking for it — if a DSL eventually crystallizes, it should crystallize the patterns the consolidation work has already validated, not invent new ones; (b) it's the right frame if/when Discord does become untenable, and having thought about it is cheaper than needing it without having thought about it.

**Revisit when**: (1) CPD is at a low baseline and the remaining command boilerplate visibly wants to be a builder function (`defineSlashCommand({ name, options, intent, onInvoke })`) rather than raw `SlashCommandBuilder` chains, or (2) a concrete portability requirement appears (Discord API change, new platform target, web UI project).

**Current state (2026-04-13 investigation)**: the codebase is already **~45–55% DSL-shaped**. `defineCommand()` at `services/bot-client/src/utils/defineCommand.ts:57-162` already serves as the DSL nucleus — it enforces command contracts, abstracts deferral modes (with context-type variance: `ModalCommandContext` vs `DeferredCommandContext` vs `SafeCommandContext`), and declares component routing via `componentPrefixes`. Shared utilities cover browse/dashboard/session/modal patterns comprehensively (see table in `.claude/rules/04-discord.md`). Empirical utility-call density: browse commands ~7% of LOC, dashboard commands ~13%.

**What `defineCommand` does NOT yet absorb** (the residual boilerplate a full DSL would need to cover): `SlashCommandBuilder` chain construction (e.g., `commands/character/index.ts:215-388` is 174 LOC of Discord.js tree), option parsing via per-command codegen helpers, subcommand routing via external factories (`createMixedModeSubcommandRouter`, `createTypedSubcommandRouter`), error-handling try-catch wrapping, and `ModalBuilder` / `TextInputBuilder` chains.

**What Phases 5–6 of the Active Epic would push further**: `requireDashboardSession` (~8 clones), dashboard modal/select handlers (~6 clones), subcommand router consolidation (~3 clones). After those land, ~35–50 LOC per command remains as essentially irreducible `SlashCommandBuilder` + `ModalBuilder` tree construction. That's Discord.js API surface and can't go into a utility without either (a) code generation, (b) a declarative schema compiler, or (c) a thinner-than-Discord.js DSL that accepts less API control.

**Framing insight**: a realistic DSL could eliminate 50–60% of per-command boilerplate; the remaining 40–50% IS the Discord.js API surface — which is also exactly what a cross-platform abstraction layer would need to replace. So the irreducible-boilerplate problem and the portability problem are the same problem viewed from two angles. This suggests the "revisit" trigger isn't really about CPD reaching zero — it's about whether the cost of a schema compiler or code generator is worth paying, which correlates with how seriously we're pursuing portability.

**User's own framing**: "Probably a bit pie in the sky, but I want to at least think about it."

### Code Quality

#### 🏗️ Unify Shapes Job Error Handlers

`handleExportError` (ShapesExportJob.ts) and `handleImportError` (ShapesImportJob.ts) are near-identical: `willRetry` computation, three-way log message, re-throw or mark DB as failed. Extract to a shared helper in `shapesCredentials.ts` or a new `shapesJobHelpers.ts`.

#### 🧹 Audit Existing Tests for Type Violations

Review all `*.test.ts` files to ensure they match their naming convention.

### Low-Priority Audits

- **Audit API Routes for Zod Validation** — Several routes use manual `typeof` + `isValidDiscordId()` instead of Zod schemas at boundaries. Large scope, no recent production impact. Discovered PR #688.
- **DB-Sync Deletion Propagation** — Cross-env sync only upserts, so prod deletions get undone on re-sync. Workaround: manual cleanup. Needs design decision (tombstones, deletion log, sync manifest). Low urgency.

### Nice-to-Have Features

- **Release Notifications** - `/changelog` command, announcement channel, GitHub webhook
- **Remove Dashboard Close Button** - Redundant with Discord's native "Dismiss Message" on ephemeral messages. Sessions auto-expire via Redis TTL (15 min) anyway.
- **Align Preset Browse UX with Character Browse** - Characters group by owner with clear section headers and consistent emoji badges (from the Emoji Standardization epic). Presets still use a flat list with ad-hoc badging. Needs: owner grouping, standardized emoji badges, consistent legend formatting.

### Tooling Polish

#### 🏗️ Type-Safe Command Options Hardening

- [ ] CI validation for `commandOptions.ts` schema-handler drift
- [ ] AST-based parsing for robustness
- [ ] Channel type refinement

#### 🧹 Railway Ops CLI Enhancements

Low priority quality-of-life improvements.

#### ✨ Dynamic Model Selection for Presets

Fetch OpenRouter model list dynamically instead of hardcoded options.

#### 🏗️ Slash Command UX Audit

Full audit of all slash command UI patterns. Review shared utilities usage, identify gaps/inconsistencies, standardize patterns.

#### 🧹 Free-Tier Model Strategy

Define free-tier model allowlist, usage quotas, upgrade prompts.

#### 🐛 Revisit Vision `maxAttempts` After Telemetry Data

**Problem**: Vision retry cap set to `maxAttempts: 2` (1 initial + 1 retry) on 2026-04-14 without empirical retry-success-rate data for AbortError-originated TIMEOUT errors. Council argued for 1 attempt (0 retries) on the assumption that 90s-budget AbortErrors are near-100% deterministic per URL. Kept 2 attempts until measurement proves otherwise.

**Action**: After 1–2 weeks of prod telemetry from the vision-pipeline diagnostic bundle, grep ai-worker logs for `attempt=2` successes on operations where `attempt=1` failed with `errorCategory=timeout`. If retry success rate on TIMEOUT is <5%, cut `VISION_MAX_ATTEMPTS` in `services/ai-worker/src/jobs/ImageDescriptionJob.ts` to 1. If >20%, keep at 2. Between, reconsider with fresh eyes.

**Why out of scope now**: Cannot decide empirically without the telemetry the diagnostic bundle installs.

#### 🧹 Deduplicate `parseApiError` Calls in Retry Path

**Problem**: `ImageDescriptionJob` (and other vision-adjacent callers) pass both `shouldRetry: shouldRetryError` and `getErrorContext: getErrorLogContext` to `withRetry`. Each wrapper internally calls `parseApiError(error)`, so every failed attempt parses the same error twice. Not a correctness issue — both return the same result for a given input — but inefficient if the parser grows more expensive (e.g., deeper cause-chain traversal, richer classification).

**Action**: Add an optional `getErrorContext` variant that receives a pre-parsed `ApiErrorInfo` instead of raw error, or have `withRetry` expose the parsed info from its own `shouldRetry` call into `getErrorContext`. Either approach removes the duplicate parse without changing the external surface for callers that don't need it.

**Why out of scope**: Efficiency nit flagged during PR #802 review; the parser is currently cheap (regex + switch) so duplication is zero-impact in practice. Fix when touching the retry primitive for other reasons.

#### 🐛 `modelName` Lost as Structured Attribute Field After LLMInvoker Log Deletion

**Problem**: PR #802 deleted the `[LLMInvoker] LLM invocation completed` log which had `modelName` as a top-level structured field (queryable via Railway DSL `@modelName:claude-sonnet-4-6`). The replacement `withRetry` success log embeds model name inside `operationName: "LLM invocation (claude-sonnet-4-6)"` — still substring-searchable but no longer an attribute filter. Per-model latency/success-rate queries are harder.

**Action**: Add an optional `extraLogFields: Record<string, unknown>` option to `RetryOptions` that spreads into every lifecycle log. `LLMInvoker` can then pass `extraLogFields: { modelName }` to restore the structured field without reintroducing a second log line. Alternative: extract model name from `operationName` via a Railway query macro — less ergonomic.

**Why out of scope**: Legit queryability regression but low priority for a solo-dev workflow where substring search suffices. Right home is the Observability & Telemetry Strategy epic in Future Themes — that epic will standardize the `extraLogFields` / `dimensions` pattern across all retry-like primitives.

#### 🐛 Revisit `TIMEOUTS.VISION_MODEL` After Telemetry Data

**Problem**: 90s vision-model timeout may be mis-calibrated. 63% hit rate in 2026-04-14 prod-log analysis suggests systemic (provider/CDN stall) rather than "almost-long-enough." If p95 successful response times are 25–35s, 90s is 2–3x overkill.

**Action**: After 1–2 weeks of prod telemetry, analyze `durationMs` distribution from `[Retry] Image description succeeded on attempt` log entries. Tune `TIMEOUTS.VISION_MODEL` in `packages/common-types/src/constants/timing.ts` to p99 + small headroom.

**Why out of scope now**: Cannot tune without the telemetry the diagnostic bundle installs.

| JobTracker "Completed job" log on orphan-release | `completeJob` emits `logger.info("Completed job after Xs")` regardless of why it was called, so an orphan-sweep release at 40 min reads like a successful completion in logs. Flagged in PR #820 round 2. The preceding `logger.warn` from `scheduleOrphanSweep` provides correlation context, and passing an `isOrphan` flag (or splitting into a separate `forceReleaseJob` method) adds complexity for a rare path. Revisit if we need to distinguish these in aggregated log queries. Start: `services/bot-client/src/services/JobTracker.ts` `completeJob`.          |
