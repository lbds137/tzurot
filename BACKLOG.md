## 🚨 Production Issues

_Active bugs observed in production. Fix before new features._

### 🐛 Free Model Error Handling (GLM/Z-AI) — PARTIALLY FIXED

**Observed**: 2026-02-03 to 2026-02-05
**Debug files**: `debug/400_*.json`, `debug/glm_4.5_air_*.json`

Provider returns 400 error but response may contain usable content. Currently treated as total failure.

**Root causes identified and fixed (on `develop`, pending deploy)**:

- [x] `frequency_penalty` causes 400 on GLM 4.5 Air (restricted param set) — **fixed**: parameter filtering in ModelFactory
- [x] `maxTokens` defaulting to 4096 instead of auto-scaling for reasoning models — **fixed**: made maxTokens optional, removed hardcoded default
- [x] Missing model detection patterns (GPT-OSS, StepFun, Hermes 4, MiMo) — **fixed**: added to reasoningModelUtils
- [x] Stop sequences sent to models that don't support them (R1-0528:free) — **fixed**: added to blocklist

**Remaining**:

- [x] Check for extractable content before throwing on 400 — **fixed in PR #587**: `tryRecoverErrorContent()` extracts valid content from 400 responses
- [ ] GLM 4.5 Air empty reasoning with low `maxTokens` — model skips thinking when budget is tight (may be unavoidable)

### 🐛 Error UX Improvements (Quota + General)

**Observed**: 2026-02-03
**Debug file**: `debug/402_quota_exceeded.json`

Errors show generic messages without enough context for debugging. Users (and admins) need both human-friendly category AND technical details.

**Symptoms**:

- `nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b:free` returns 402 quota exceeded
- User sees generic "something went wrong" instead of "Model quota exceeded - try again later"
- No visibility into actual error code/message for debugging
- No fallback to other free models

**Fix approach - Error Display** (MOSTLY DONE — PR #587):

- [x] Standardize error response format: `{ category, userMessage, technicalDetails }` — unified `ApiErrorInfo` with Zod schema
- [x] Discord embeds show category (bold) + user-friendly message — `USER_ERROR_MESSAGES[category]`
- [x] Add collapsible/spoiler section with technical details (error code, provider message, request ID) — `formatErrorSpoiler()`
- [ ] Admin errors can show full technical context; user errors show sanitized version

**Fix approach - Quota Handling** (PARTIALLY DONE — PR #587):

- [x] Detect 402 quota errors specifically — `apiErrorParser` classifies 402 → `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`
- [x] Show user-friendly "model quota exceeded, try again in a few minutes" message — `USER_ERROR_MESSAGES.QUOTA_EXCEEDED`
- [ ] Consider automatic fallback to alternative free model
- [ ] Track quota hits per model to avoid repeated failures

## 📥 Inbox

_New items go here. Triage to appropriate section weekly._

### ✨ Expose `max_tokens` in Preset Edit/Creation Flow

**Context**: Top-level `max_tokens` (output token limit) is not exposed in the Discord preset dashboard. Users can only set it by manually editing `advanced_parameters` in the DB. This became apparent when GLM 4.5 Air configs had `reasoning.max_tokens` set but no top-level `max_tokens`, causing the model to use a scaled default instead of an explicit value.

**What to add**:

- [ ] Add `max_tokens` field to preset create/edit dashboard (numeric input)
- [ ] Show current effective value (explicit, scaled from reasoning effort, or API default)
- [ ] Sensible range validation (e.g., 256–131072) with model-specific guidance
- [ ] Help text: "Maximum tokens in the response. Leave empty to auto-scale based on reasoning effort."

**Priority**: Medium — power users need this, casual users are fine with auto-scaling.

### ✨ Reasoning Param UX: Effort vs Max Tokens Mutual Exclusivity

**Context**: OpenRouter only accepts ONE of `reasoning.effort` OR `reasoning.max_tokens`, not both. Our `buildReasoningParams()` silently drops `max_tokens` when `effort` is set, but the UI doesn't communicate this. Users set both and wonder why `max_tokens` has no effect.

**What to add**:

- [ ] When `reasoning.effort` is set, disable/hide `reasoning.max_tokens` field
- [ ] Tooltip or inline help: "Effort level and token budget are mutually exclusive. Effort is recommended for most use cases."
- [ ] If both exist in saved config, show a warning badge on the reasoning section
- [ ] Consider: validation in `configValidation.ts` that warns about this conflict

**Priority**: Medium — prevents confusion for anyone configuring reasoning models.

### 🧹 Add maxAge=0 Edge Case Test

**Context**: PR #584 review noted missing test coverage for `maxAge = 0` validation.

**Current behavior is correct** (rejects 0, requires null for no limit), just needs explicit test:

```typescript
it('should reject maxAge = 0 (use null for no limit)', () => {
  const input = { name: 'Test', model: 'test-model', maxAge: 0 };
  expect(LlmConfigCreateSchema.safeParse(input).success).toBe(false);
});
```

**File**: `packages/common-types/src/types/llm-config.schema.test.ts`

## 🎯 Current Focus

_This week's active work. Max 3 items._

### 🏗️ Zod Schema Hardening - Phase 1 (CAUSES PRODUCTION BUGS)

**Recent bug**: `isForwarded` field missing from `apiConversationMessageSchema` caused forwarded messages to lose their `forwarded="true"` attribute in prompts. Data silently disappeared.

**Immediate fixes (DONE)**:

- [x] Regression test for `isForwarded` in `schemas.test.ts`
- [x] Field preservation test for `apiConversationMessageSchema`

**This week - Consolidate remaining endpoint schemas**:

- [ ] Consolidate Persona endpoint schemas (admin + user)
- [ ] Consolidate Model override endpoint schemas
- [ ] Pattern: Shared Zod schemas in common-types, scope-aware service layer

---

## ⚡️ Quick Wins

_Small tasks that can be done between major features. Good for momentum._

### 🏗️ Schema Cleanup: Remove Legacy `extendedContext*` Columns

**Context**: `extendedContext` toggle was removed — always enabled now. New context columns (`maxMessages`, `maxAge`, `maxImages`) replaced it. Legacy columns still exist in DB.

**Prerequisite**: Verify new context columns working in production first.

- [ ] Migration: Remove `extendedContext*` columns from AdminSettings
- [ ] Migration: Remove `extendedContext*` columns from ChannelSettings
- [ ] Migration: Remove `extendedContext*` columns from Personality
- [ ] Delete `getRecentHistory()` method (if still present)
- [ ] Clean up Prisma schema definitions

### ✨ Bot Health Status

Admin command showing bot health and diagnostics.

- [ ] `/admin health` - Show uptime, version, connected services
- [ ] Include: Discord connection, Redis, PostgreSQL, BullMQ queue depth
- [ ] Optional: memory usage, active personality count

### ✨ Bot Presence Setting

Allow setting the bot's status message (like user status).

- [ ] `/admin presence set <type> <message>` - Set bot presence (Playing, Watching, etc.)
- [ ] `/admin presence clear` - Clear custom presence
- [ ] Persist across restarts (store in database or env)

### ✨ Discord Emoji/Sticker Image Support

Support custom Discord emoji and stickers in vision context.

- [ ] Extract emoji URLs from message content (custom emoji format: `<:name:id>`)
- [ ] Extract sticker URLs from message stickers
- [ ] Include in vision context alongside attachments
- [ ] Handle animated emoji/stickers (GIF vs static)

### 🧹 Redis Failure Injection Tests

SessionManager has acknowledged gap in testing Redis failure scenarios. Add failure injection tests for graceful degradation verification.

### 🧹 Release Notifications

Notify users of new releases.

- [ ] `/changelog` command showing recent releases
- [ ] Optional announcement channel integration
- [ ] GitHub releases webhook

## 🏗 Active Epic: Zod Schema Hardening

_Focus: Prevent silent data loss from schema/interface mismatch._

**Problem areas** (consolidated from multiple backlog items):

1. **Schema/Interface Mismatch** - Zod strips fields not in schema. When we add fields to TS interfaces but forget Zod, data silently disappears.
2. **Inconsistent Validation** - Mix of manual type checks, Zod schemas, and `as Type` casting across routes.
3. **Response Inconsistency** - Same resource returns different fields from GET vs POST vs PUT.
4. **Admin/User Duplication** - Persona and Model override endpoints still have duplicate schemas (LlmConfig and Personality already consolidated in PRs #582, #583).

### Phase 1: Consolidate Remaining Endpoints (IN CURRENT FOCUS)

Pattern: Shared Zod schemas in common-types, scope-aware service layer.

### Phase 2: Compile-Time Enforcement (Option B - Pragmatic)

- [ ] Create `ZodShape<T>` utility type that maps interface keys to Zod types
- [ ] Use `satisfies ZodShape<ApiInterface>` on schemas to get compile errors for missing fields
- [ ] Challenge: Internal types (Date) differ from API types (string), need separate API interfaces

### Phase 3: Schema-First Architecture (Option A - Ideal, Longer-Term)

- [ ] Make Zod schemas the single source of truth for API types
- [ ] Derive TypeScript types using `z.infer<typeof schema>`
- [ ] Internal types with Date remain separate, conversion at boundaries
- [ ] New types should be schema-first from the start

### Phase 4: Standardize Validation (Cleanup)

- [ ] Audit: `routes/user/*.ts`, `routes/admin/*.ts`, `routes/internal/*.ts`
- [ ] Use `safeParse` consistently everywhere
- [ ] Shared response builder functions per resource type

**Reference**: MCP council recommendation (2026-02-04) - Option A is ideal, Option B is pragmatic

## 📅 Next Epic: Package Extraction

_Focus: Reduce common-types bloat and improve module boundaries._

common-types has 607 exports (12x the 50-export threshold). bot-client is 45.7K lines with 767 exports.

- [ ] Reassess common-types export count — if still >50, extract domain packages
- [ ] Candidates: `@tzurot/discord-dashboard` (30 files, self-contained), `@tzurot/message-references` (12 files), `@tzurot/discord-command-context` (6 files)
- [ ] Reference: PR #558 analysis

**Previous work**: Architecture Health epic (PRs #593, #594, #596, #597) completed dead code purge, oversized file splits, 400-line max-lines limit, and circular dependency resolution (54→25, all remaining are generated Prisma code).

## 📦 Future Themes

_Epics ordered by dependency. Pick the next one when current epic completes._

### Theme: Memory System Overhaul

_Dependency chain: Configuration Consolidation → LTM Summarization → Table Migration → OpenMemory_

#### 1. ✨ LTM Summarization (Shapes.inc Style)

Verbatim conversation storage is redundant with extended context. Replace with LLM-generated summaries.

- [ ] Configurable grouping (5, 10, 50 messages or 1h, 4h, 24h time windows)
- [ ] Separate LLM call for summarization (fast/cheap model)
- [ ] Store summaries as LTM instead of verbatim turns

#### 2. 🏗️ Memories Table Migration

Two formats coexist (shapes.inc imports vs tzurot-v3 verbatim). Need unified format.

- [ ] Design unified memory format (draw from both sources)
- [ ] One-time migration of existing tzurot-v3 memories
- [ ] Run existing verbatim memories through summarizer

#### 3. 🏗️ OpenMemory Migration

Waypoint graph architecture with multi-sector storage.

- [ ] Design waypoint graph schema
- [ ] Migration path from current flat memories
- [ ] See `docs/proposals/backlog/OPENMEMORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

#### 🏗️ Per-User Quotas

No limits on memories per persona. Add `maxMemoriesPerPersona` (default: 10,000).

#### 🏗️ Contrastive Retrieval for RAG

Improve memory retrieval quality with contrastive methods.

---

### Theme: Character Portability

_Import and export characters and user data. Users own their data._

#### ✨ User Data Export

Unified export of all user-owned data. Currently preset export and character export exist but are separate.

- [ ] `/me export` command - download all user data as JSON/ZIP
- [ ] Include: personas, presets, LLM configs, memories, conversation history
- [ ] Include: user settings, timezone, API keys (masked)
- [ ] Consider: character cards (PNG with embedded metadata) for personalities
- [ ] Privacy: only export data the user owns or has created

**Existing partial implementations**: `/preset export`, `/character export`

#### ✨ Character Card Import

Import V2/V3 character cards (PNG with embedded metadata). SillyTavern compatibility.

- [ ] Parse PNG metadata (V2 JSON in tEXt chunk, V3 in separate format)
- [ ] Map character card fields to v3 personality schema
- [ ] `/character import` support for PNG files

#### 🏗️ Shapes.inc Import

Migration path from v2. Legacy data migration.

Prevents bot from spamming unwanted channels, reduces server kicks.

- [ ] Add `mode` (allowlist/denylist) and `channels` array to ChannelSettings
- [ ] `/channel restrict` command for server admins
- [ ] Middleware check in message handler
- [ ] Consider "Ghost Mode" - bot listens but only replies when pinged

#### ✨ Multi-Character Invocation Per Message

Support tagging multiple characters in one message, each responding in order.

**Example**: `@character1 @character2 hello both` → both respond sequentially

- [ ] Modify mention extraction to return array of all valid mentions
- [ ] Combine reply target + mentions into ordered list (reply first, then mentions L→R)
- [ ] Add max limit (3-4 characters per message) to prevent abuse

#### ✨ Emoji Reaction Actions

Allow emoji reactions to trigger personality actions.

- [ ] Define action mapping (❤️ = positive feedback, 👎 = regenerate, etc.)
- [ ] Hook into reaction events (reactionAdd handler)
- [ ] Action dispatch based on emoji → action mapping

#### 🏗️ Streaming Responses

Stream LLM responses to Discord for better UX on long generations.

#### 🏗️ Consistent Service Prefix Injection

Auto-inject `[ServiceName]` prefix in logs instead of hardcoding.

#### 🧹 Logging Verbosity Audit

Some operations log at INFO when they should be DEBUG.

#### 🏗️ File Naming Convention Audit

Inconsistent casing between services. Low value / high effort.

#### 🏗️ Incognito Mode - Parallel API Calls
