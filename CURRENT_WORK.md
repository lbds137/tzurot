## Session Progress: Slash Command Timeout Fix

**PR #385** (ready for merge): `release: v3.0.0-beta.25 - Fix slash command timeouts with caching and top-level deferral`

**Root Cause**: Discord autocomplete fires HTTP requests on every keystroke. Combined with channel activation checks on every message, this caused HTTP connection pool saturation → 3-second Discord timeout exceeded → "Unknown interaction" error.

**Fixes Applied**:
- TTL cache for personality/persona autocomplete (60s TTL, 500 users max)
- TTL cache for channel activation lookups (30s TTL)
- Moved `deferReply` to top-level interactionCreate handler
- Removed redundant `deferEphemeral` from individual command handlers
- Fixed critical bug: empty persona list incorrectly treated as cache miss

**Test Coverage**: 4,385 tests passing, 100% coverage on autocompleteCache.ts and GatewayClient.ts

**Remaining in backlog** (for future sessions):
- Investigate HTTP agent pool isolation (Discord vs Gateway)
- Improve `/channel list` command (pagination, permissions, scope filtering)

## Active: Memory Management Commands

**Reference**: [docs/planning/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md](docs/planning/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md)

**Phase 1 (STM) - COMPLETE** (shipped in beta.19):

- [x] `/history clear` - Epoch-based soft reset (hides old messages from AI context)
- [x] `/history undo` - Restore cleared context
- [x] `/history hard-delete` - Permanent deletion with confirmation
- [x] `/history view` - See current context window status
- [x] Per-persona epoch tracking

**Phase 2 (LTM) - NOT STARTED:**

- [ ] `/memory search` - Semantic search with filtering
- [ ] `/memory browse` - Paginated memory deck UI
- [ ] `/memory edit` - Edit memory content (regenerate embedding)
- [ ] `/memory delete` - Single memory deletion
- [ ] `/memory purge` - Bulk deletion with typed confirmation
- [ ] `/memory lock/unlock` - Core memory protection

**Phase 3 (Incognito) - NOT STARTED:**

- [ ] `/incognito enable/disable/status/forget`
