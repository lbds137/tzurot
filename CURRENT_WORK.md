# ðŸŽ¯ Current Work

## Status: v3 Development Deployment Active

**v3 has been deployed and running on Railway for 14+ days (development environment)**

- Branch: `feat/v3-continued`
- Environment: Railway "development" environment (private testing)
- Status: Stable and operational
- **NOT PUBLIC**: All API costs currently on owner's dime, no BYOK yet

## What v3 Actually Has Working

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- TypeScript monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Three microservices deployed on Railway:
  - **api-gateway**: HTTP API + BullMQ job queue
  - **ai-worker**: AI processing with Qdrant memory
  - **bot-client**: Discord.js client with webhooks
- PostgreSQL + Redis + Qdrant vector database
- OpenRouter + Gemini AI providers

### âœ… Features Working in Dev Deployment
- @personality mentions (@lilith, @default, @sarcastic)
- Reply detection (reply to bot messages to continue conversation)
- Webhook management (unique avatar/name per personality)
- Message chunking (handles Discord's 2000 char limit)
- Conversation history tracking
- Long-term memory via Qdrant vectors
- Image attachment support
- Voice transcription support
- Model indicator in responses
- Persistent typing indicators
- Basic slash commands (/ping, /help)

### ðŸ“‹ Not Yet Ported from v2
- Auto-response (activated channels)
- Full slash command system (/personality add/remove/list/info)
- Rate limiting
- NSFW verification
- Request deduplication

### ðŸš§ Blockers for Public Production Launch
**Critical** (required before public use):
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Users must provide their own OpenRouter/Gemini API keys
- **Admin Commands**: Bot owner needs slash commands to:
  - `/admin servers` - List all servers bot is currently in
  - `/admin kick <server_id>` - Force remove bot from a server
  - `/admin usage` - View API usage and costs per server/user

**Important** (nice to have):
- Cost tracking/alerting per user
- Usage quotas to prevent abuse
- Better error messages for missing API keys

## Recent Work (Past 2 Weeks)

Fixing dev deployment issues:
- âœ… Message chunking (Discord 2000 char limit handling)
- âœ… Job timeout scaling based on image count
- âœ… Conversation history timestamp fixes
- âœ… Model indicators and typing indicators
- âœ… Qdrant memory retrieval improvements
