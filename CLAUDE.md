## Project Overview

Tzurot is a Discord bot that uses webhooks to represent multiple AI personalities. It allows users to add personalities and interact with them through Discord channels. The bot is built using Node.js and Discord.js.

## Key Commands

### Development Commands
- `npm start` - Start the bot in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the bot with nodemon for development (auto-restart on file changes)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier to format code
- `npm run quality` - Run both lint and format checks
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
- Run a specific test: `npx jest tests/unit/path/to/test.js`

### IMPORTANT: After making code changes
- Always run `npm run lint` to check code quality
- Always run `npm test` to verify that your changes don't break existing functionality
- For test-driven development, use `npm run test:watch`
- When running the full test suite with `npm test`, update the `docs/testing/TEST_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md` file with the latest coverage information

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Bot (`bot.js`)**: Main entry point for Discord interaction, handling messages, commands, and webhooks.
   - Routes messages to appropriate handlers
   - Supports both guild channels and direct messages (DMs)
   - Manages message deduplication to prevent duplicate responses

2. **Personality Manager (`personalityManager.js`)**: Manages AI personalities.
   - Registers new personalities
   - Handles aliases for personalities
   - Loads/saves personality data to disk

3. **Webhook Manager (`webhookManager.js`)**: Handles Discord webhooks for personality messages.
   - Creates and caches webhooks for each channel
   - Manages message splitting for content exceeding Discord limits
   - Processes media attachments (audio and images) in both webhooks and DMs
   - Provides fallback for DM channels (where webhooks aren't available)

4. **AI Service (`aiService.js`)**: Interface with the AI API.
   - Sends requests to the AI service
   - Manages proper error handling
   - Handles multimodal content (text, image, audio)

5. **Conversation Manager (`conversationManager.js`)**: Tracks active conversations.
   - Maps message IDs to personality data
   - Manages continuations of conversations

6. **Commands System**: Processes Discord commands.
   - Commands are modular and located in `src/commands/handlers/`
   - Command system uses middleware for auth, permissions, and deduplication
   - New commands should follow the existing pattern in handlers directory

7. **Media Handling**: Processes media attachments.
   - `src/utils/media/mediaHandler.js` - Central media processing
   - `src/utils/media/audioHandler.js` - Audio file processing
   - `src/utils/media/imageHandler.js` - Image file processing

### Data Flow

1. User sends message to Discord
2. Discord.js client receives message event
3. `bot.js` processes the message:
   - If it's a command (starts with prefix), route to command system
   - If it's a reply to a personality, look up the personality and continue conversation
   - If it's a mention (@personality), find the personality and start conversation
   - If there's an active conversation or channel-activated personality, continue with that personality
4. For AI response generation:
   - `aiService.js` sends request to AI API with personality name
   - Response is sent via webhook using `webhookManager.js`
   - Conversation data is recorded in `conversationManager.js`

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use single quotes for strings
- Always use semicolons
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- IMPORTANT: Use JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Keep file sizes manageable:
  - Target file size should be under 1000 lines
  - Absolutely avoid files larger than 1500 lines whenever possible
  - Break large files into smaller, more modular components
  - Large files make code harder to understand and also exceed token limits (25k max)

## Error Handling Guidelines

- IMPORTANT: Always wrap async operations in try/catch blocks
- Log all errors with appropriate context using the logger
- Never use empty catch blocks (no error swallowing)
- For webhooks and API calls, implement retries with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error messages to users when appropriate

## Testing Guidelines

- Jest is used as the testing framework
- Keep test files parallel to the implementation (same directory structure)
- Use Jest's mocking system to replace external dependencies
- Use `beforeEach` to reset state between tests
- Mock console methods to keep test output clean
- Use the existing mock implementations in `tests/mocks/`
- NEVER alter real functionality solely to make a test pass
  - Never create special code paths that are only used in testing
  - This defeats the purpose of testing since you're not testing what runs in production
  - Use proper mocking and dependency injection instead
  - If tests are hard to write, it's often a sign the code needs refactoring
- NEVER skip tests as a solution to fixing failures
  - Tests exist to validate functionality, skipping them bypasses this validation
  - Always fix the underlying issue causing the test to fail
  - If a test case is no longer valid, update it to match current expected behavior
  - Maintain the same level of test coverage when updating tests
- If you run the full test suite (`npm test`), update `/home/deck/WebstormProjects/tzurot/docs/testing/TEST_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md`
  - Do not update the summary when running partial tests
  - The summary should always reflect the result of a complete test run

## Known Issues and Patterns

### Error Prevention
- Multiple layers of error handling are implemented
- Message deduplication occurs at several levels
- Always maintain these safety mechanisms

### Caching System
- Webhook caching reduces Discord API calls
- Profile info caching reduces AI API calls 
- Message tracking prevents duplicate processing

### Media Handling
- System supports audio and image attachments
- References to media (like replies) require special handling
- DM channels require different media handling than guild channels

   - Adding new dependencies (`npm install <package>`)
   - Removing dependencies
   - Changing package versions

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Modifying `package.json` dependencies
   - Changing core configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `jest.config.js`, etc.)

3. **Git Operations**
   - Do not push to remote repositories (will trigger deployment)
   - Commits are allowed but discuss significant changes first
   - Branch operations should be explicitly requested

### Best Practices
1. Always run tests after making changes: `npm test`
2. Always run linting checks: `npm run lint`
3. Validate changes in a development environment before committing
4. Use the Task agent when analyzing unfamiliar areas of the codebase
5. When working with the command system, use the test scripts in `/scripts` to verify functionality
6. Use Batch to run multiple tools in parallel when appropriate
7. Never abandon challenging tasks or take shortcuts to avoid difficult work
8. If you need more time or context to properly complete a task, communicate this honestly
9. Take pride in your work and maintain high standards even when faced with obstacles

### Task Management and To-Do Lists
1. **Maintain Comprehensive To-Do Lists**: Use the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools extensively to create and manage detailed task lists.
   - Create a to-do list at the start of any non-trivial task or multi-step process
   - Be thorough and specific in task descriptions, including file paths and implementation details when relevant
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, clearly defined subtasks
   - Include success criteria for each task when possible

2. **Prioritize and Track Progress Meticulously**:
   - Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting work on them
   - Update task status to `completed` immediately after completing each task
   - Add new tasks that emerge during the work process
   - Provide detailed context for each task to ensure work can be resumed if the conversation is interrupted or context is reset

3. **Context Resilience Strategy**:
   - Write to-do lists with the assumption that context might be lost or compacted
   - Include sufficient detail in task descriptions to enable work continuation even with minimal context
   - When implementing complex solutions, document the approach and rationale in the to-do list
   - Regularly update the to-do list with your current progress and next steps

4. **Organize To-Do Lists by Component or Feature**:
   - Group related tasks together
   - Maintain a hierarchical structure where appropriate
   - Include dependencies between tasks when they exist
   - For test-related tasks, include specifics about test expectations and mocking requirements
