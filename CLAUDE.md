## Project Overview

Tzurot is a Discord bot that uses webhooks to represent multiple AI personalities. It allows users to add personalities and interact with them through Discord channels. The bot is built using Node.js and Discord.js.

## Key Commands

### Development Commands
- `npm start` - Start the bot in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the bot with nodemon for development (auto-restart on file changes)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier to format code
- `npm run quality` - Run both lint and format checks
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
- Run a specific test: `npx jest tests/unit/path/to/test.js`

### IMPORTANT: After making code changes
- Always run `npm run lint` to check code quality
- Always run `npm test` to verify that your changes don't break existing functionality
- For test-driven development, use `npm run test:watch`

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Bot (`bot.js`)**: Main entry point for Discord interaction, handling messages, commands, and webhooks.
   - Routes messages to appropriate handlers
   - Supports both guild channels and direct messages (DMs)
   - Manages message deduplication to prevent duplicate responses

2. **Personality Manager (`personalityManager.js`)**: Manages AI personalities.
   - Registers new personalities
   - Handles aliases for personalities
   - Loads/saves personality data to disk

3. **Webhook Manager (`webhookManager.js`)**: Handles Discord webhooks for personality messages.
   - Creates and caches webhooks for each channel
   - Manages message splitting for content exceeding Discord limits
   - Processes media attachments (audio and images) in both webhooks and DMs
   - Provides fallback for DM channels (where webhooks aren't available)

4. **AI Service (`aiService.js`)**: Interface with the AI API.
   - Sends requests to the AI service
   - Manages proper error handling
   - Handles multimodal content (text, image, audio)

5. **Conversation Manager (`conversationManager.js`)**: Tracks active conversations.
   - Maps message IDs to personality data
   - Manages continuations of conversations

6. **Commands System**: Processes Discord commands.
   - Commands are modular and located in `src/commands/handlers/`
   - Command system uses middleware for auth, permissions, and deduplication
   - New commands should follow the existing pattern in handlers directory

7. **Media Handling**: Processes media attachments.
   - `src/utils/media/mediaHandler.js` - Central media processing
   - `src/utils/media/audioHandler.js` - Audio file processing
   - `src/utils/media/imageHandler.js` - Image file processing

### Data Flow

1. User sends message to Discord
2. Discord.js client receives message event
3. `bot.js` processes the message:
   - If it's a command (starts with prefix), route to command system
   - If it's a reply to a personality, look up the personality and continue conversation
   - If it's a mention (@personality), find the personality and start conversation
   - If there's an active conversation or channel-activated personality, continue with that personality
4. For AI response generation:
   - `aiService.js` sends request to AI API with personality name
   - Response is sent via webhook using `webhookManager.js`
   - Conversation data is recorded in `conversationManager.js`

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use single quotes for strings
- Always use semicolons
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- IMPORTANT: Use JSDoc comments for exported functions

## Error Handling Guidelines

- IMPORTANT: Always wrap async operations in try/catch blocks
- Log all errors with appropriate context using the logger
- Never use empty catch blocks (no error swallowing)
- For webhooks and API calls, implement retries with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error messages to users when appropriate

## Testing Guidelines

- Jest is used as the testing framework
- Keep test files parallel to the implementation (same directory structure)
- Use Jest's mocking system to replace external dependencies
- Use `beforeEach` to reset state between tests
- Mock console methods to keep test output clean
- Use the existing mock implementations in `tests/mocks/`

## Known Issues and Patterns

### Error Prevention
- Multiple layers of error handling are implemented
- Message deduplication occurs at several levels
- Always maintain these safety mechanisms

### Caching System
- Webhook caching reduces Discord API calls
- Profile info caching reduces AI API calls 
- Message tracking prevents duplicate processing

### Media Handling
- System supports audio and image attachments
- References to media (like replies) require special handling
- DM channels require different media handling than guild channels
