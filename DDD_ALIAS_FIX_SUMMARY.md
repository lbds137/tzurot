# DDD Command Alias Routing Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PurgbotCommand Context Property Issue
**Problem**: PurgbotCommand was looking for `context.rawMessage` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed to use `context.message` and `context.channel`

### 2. Command Alias Routing Investigation
**Finding**: The alias routing logic is actually working correctly! 

## Testing Results

Created and ran a comprehensive test that shows all aliases route correctly:
- `purgbot` → routes to NEW ✅
- `cleandm` → routes to NEW ✅ (alias)
- `purgebot` → routes to NEW ✅ (alias)
- `clearbot` → routes to NEW ✅ (alias)
- All other command aliases also work correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

If aliases are routing to legacy instead of DDD, check:

### 1. Feature Flags
Ensure these environment variables are set:
```bash
FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_INTEGRATION=true
FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_ENABLED=true
FEATURE_FLAG_DDD_COMMANDS_UTILITY=true  # For purgbot
```

### 2. Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug logging to trace:
- Whether command exists in new system
- Alias resolution (alias → primary command name)
- Feature flag checks
- Category determination

### 3. How to Debug
Run the bot with debug logging and look for:
```
[CommandIntegrationAdapter] Command "cleandm" exists in new system: true/false
[CommandIntegrationAdapter] Resolved alias "cleandm" to primary command "purgbot"
[CommandIntegrationAdapter] Category flag ddd.commands.utility = true/false
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify feature flags** in your `.env` file
2. **Run with debug logging** to see the routing decisions
3. **Check initialization** - ensure CommandIntegration is initialized before use

The alias routing code is correct - the issue is likely configuration or timing related.
