The test is whether the content explicitly frames a character as a minor (specific ages under 18, explicit references to being a child/kid in a non-roleplay context, middle school, etc.) and sexualizes that. When ambiguous, default to permissive—the prohibition targets clear cases, not edge cases.</constraint>
