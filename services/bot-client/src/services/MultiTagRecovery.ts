/**
 * MultiTagRecovery — startup hook that rehydrates in-flight multi-tag
 * fan-outs after a bot restart.
 *
 * **Why this exists**: when the bot shuts down (graceful or crash), pending
 * multi-tag fan-outs leave Redis entries behind. Without recovery, those
 * entries would never produce user-visible responses, and any results the
 * old ai-worker finished publishing AFTER the old bot-client died would be
 * silently lost — the new bot-client's fresh `QueueEvents` / Redis-Stream
 * subscriptions don't replay events emitted before they attached, even
 * though the BullMQ job state itself still holds the result.
 *
 * **Algorithm** (run BEFORE ResultsListener starts):
 *   1. Scan `multitag:entry:*` Redis keys via `MultiTagPersistence.scanAllEntries`.
 *   2. For each snapshot:
 *      - Fetch Discord channel + source message. If either fails (channel
 *        deleted, message deleted), discard the entry — the user can't be
 *        delivered to anyway.
 *      - For each pending slot: poll BullMQ for the OLD job's authoritative
 *        state via `queue.getJob().getState()`. Routes:
 *          • `'completed'` → consume `job.returnvalue` and feed it through
 *            `coordinator.handleJobResult` after adoption (deferred delivery).
 *          • `'failed'` → synthesize an error `LLMGenerationResult` from
 *            `job.failedReason` and route through the same entrypoint.
 *          • `'active' | 'waiting' | 'delayed' | 'prioritized' | 'waiting-children'` →
 *            adopt the slot as still-pending with the old jobId; the live
 *            stream + QueueEvents subscriptions will deliver the result
 *            when the ai-worker finishes.
 *          • Job evicted from Redis (`getJob` returns null) → synthesize
 *            an "unavailable after restart" failure result.
 *          • `getJob` / `getState` throws → fall back to adopting as
 *            still-pending; don't fail recovery for a transient Redis blip.
 *      - For each terminal slot in the snapshot: preserve as-is (the result
 *        was never persisted in the snapshot, so the slot will flush as an
 *        error via the existing `deliverError` path — same as before).
 *      - Adopt the rehydrated runtime entry into the coordinator's
 *        in-memory maps + register with orderingService.
 *      - After adoption, dispatch the collected deferred deliveries via
 *        `coordinator.handleJobResult(jobId, syntheticResult)`. This routes
 *        through the same flush path live results travel.
 *   3. Notify coordinator that stale jobIds exist (flips the
 *      `staleCheckNeeded` fast-path flag) so MessageHandler runs the
 *      isStale check post-recovery for any entries that were discarded.
 *
 * **No resubmission**: prior versions of this service resubmitted a fresh
 * AI job for every still-pending slot at recovery time. That wasted API
 * tokens and produced different content than what the user would have
 * received absent the restart — and crucially, results the prior process
 * had already produced were thrown away in favour of duplicate work. The
 * BullMQ-state poll above replaces resubmission entirely.
 *
 * **Critical ordering**: `run()` MUST complete before `ResultsListener.start()`.
 * The stale-set filter (populated during discard) is what makes results
 * for discarded entries safe to drop; without it, a delayed delivery could
 * arrive during recovery and race the discard logic. For the in-flight
 * branch, the slot retains its original jobId, so the stream/event
 * subscriptions deliver normally once they attach.
 *
 * **Discord readiness**: callers must invoke `run()` AFTER `client.login()`
 * completes — channel/message fetches require an authenticated client.
