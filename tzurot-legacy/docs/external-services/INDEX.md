## Quick Navigation Guide

### ðŸ“˜ [SHAPES_INC_API_REFERENCE.md](./SHAPES_INC_API_REFERENCE.md)
**What it contains:**
- API endpoint documentation
- Authentication methods and requirements
- Data structure specifications
- Public vs Private API comparison
- Security considerations

**Use this when you need to:**
- âœ… Understand what data is available from the API
- âœ… Look up specific API response fields

- âœ… Review authentication requirements

### ðŸ“— [SHAPES_INC_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./SHAPES_INC_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
**What it contains:**
- Migration strategy and phases
- Implementation patterns for each feature
- Infrastructure and deployment guidance
- BYOK architecture design
- Performance optimization techniques

**Use this when you need to:**
- âœ… Implement local replacements for API features
- âœ… Set up memory, voice, or knowledge systems
- âœ… Optimize for Railway deployment
- âœ… Design the migration architecture

### ðŸ“™ [CHAT_HISTORY_BACKUP_GUIDE.md](./CHAT_HISTORY_BACKUP_GUIDE.md)
**What it contains:**
- How chat history backup is seamlessly integrated
- Technical details of the `before_ts` pagination
- Storage format and incremental sync strategy
- No additional configuration needed!

**Use this when you need to:**
- âœ… Understand how chat history backup works
- âœ… Troubleshoot chat history sync issues

## Decision Tree

```
Need external service info?
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Looking for API details?
â”‚  â””â”€â†’ See API_REFERENCE.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€ Implementing a feature locally?
â”‚  â””â”€â†’ See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
â”‚
â””â”€ Need both?
   â””â”€â†’ Start with API_REFERENCE.md for context,
       then MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for implementation
```

## Notes

- This documentation is excluded from version control for security reasons
- Contains reverse-engineered API details and migration strategies
- Updates should maintain generic naming to avoid revealing service names
