# Test Coverage Status Update

## Files We Successfully Improved
1. **PersonalityDataService.js** - âœ… NOW 100% COVERAGE! (was 6.32%)
   - Used by: aiService.js
   - Comprehensive tests written

## High Priority Files Still Needing Tests
1. **messageTracker.js** - 29.54% coverage
   - ACTIVELY USED by: messageHandler, CommandAdapter, ApplicationBootstrap, etc.
   - Critical for deduplication
   
2. **aliasResolver.js** - 44.73% coverage  
   - ACTIVELY USED by: messageHandler
   - Critical for personality resolution

## Medium Priority Files
1. **auth.js** - 61.11% coverage
   - Core authentication functionality

## Files with 0% Coverage - Status Check
1. **commandProcessor.js** - Has tests but 0% coverage (suspicious)
2. **commandValidation.js** - Has tests but 0% coverage (suspicious)
3. **middleware.js** - Referenced by commandProcessor/commandValidation
4. **utils.js** - Need to check usage
5. **webhookManager.js** - 0% coverage (CRITICAL - this is core functionality!)
6. **webhookServer.js** - 0% coverage
7. **healthCheck.js** - 0% coverage
8. **httpServer.js** - 0% coverage

## Recommendation
Continue with improving test coverage for:
1. messageTracker.js (critical, actively used)
2. aliasResolver.js (critical, actively used)
3. Investigate why some files show 0% coverage despite having tests
