# Critical Test Coverage Gaps Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies critical areas of the codebase that lack proper test coverage and should be prioritized for testing. Based on the latest coverage report (May 22, 2025), the overall coverage is 52.57% statements, which leaves significant gaps in critical functionality.

## Priority 1: Core Command Processing (0% Coverage)
These files handle the fundamental command processing pipeline and have ZERO test coverage:

### 1. `src/commandProcessor.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Core command processing logic
- **Risk**: Any bugs here affect ALL commands
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Command parsing and validation
  - Error handling for malformed commands
  - Command routing to appropriate handlers
  - Permission checking integration

### 2. `src/commandValidation.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Validates command inputs
- **Risk**: Invalid inputs could crash bot or cause security issues
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Input sanitization
  - Parameter validation
  - Type checking
  - Boundary conditions

### 3. `src/middleware.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: General middleware utilities
- **Risk**: Middleware affects all message processing
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Message filtering
  - Pre-processing logic
  - Error propagation

## Priority 2: Critical Infrastructure (0% Coverage)

### 1. `src/requestRegistry.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Tracks active requests
- **Risk**: Memory leaks, lost requests, race conditions
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Request registration/deregistration
  - Timeout handling
  - Concurrent request management

### 2. `src/monitoring/deduplicationMonitor.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate message processing
- **Risk**: Duplicate responses, performance issues
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Duplicate detection accuracy
  - Performance under load
  - Cache management

### 3. `src/utils/pluralkitPatterns.js` (0% coverage)
- **Purpose**: PluralKit integration patterns
- **Risk**: Breaking integration with PluralKit system
- **Recommended tests**:
  - Pattern matching accuracy
  - Edge cases in PluralKit formats
  - Performance of regex patterns

## Priority 3: Low Coverage Core Files (<30%)

### 1. `src/bot.js` (24.32% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Main bot entry point
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Message event handling
  - Error recovery
  - Startup/shutdown procedures
  - Ready event handling

### 2. `src/webhookManager.js` (32.85% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Manages Discord webhooks for personalities
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Webhook creation failures
  - Message splitting logic
  - Media attachment handling
  - Webhook caching and cleanup

### 3. `src/commandLoader.js` (27.27% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Dynamically loads command handlers
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Failed command loading
  - Duplicate command handling
  - Command unloading/reloading

## Priority 4: Security and Authentication

### 1. `src/auth.js` (47.48% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Authentication system
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Token expiration handling
  - Permission validation
  - Multi-user scenarios
  - Auth bypass prevention

## Priority 5: User-Facing Features

### 1. `src/handlers/personalityHandler.js` (34.06% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Core personality interaction
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Personality switching
  - Context management
  - Error handling for AI failures

### 2. `src/utils/media/mediaHandler.js` (42.74% coverage)
- **Purpose**: Process media attachments
- **Critical gaps**:
  - Large file handling
  - Unsupported format handling
  - Memory management

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create tests for 0% coverage files** - These represent the highest risk
2. **Focus on command processing pipeline** - This affects all bot functionality
3. **Test authentication thoroughly** - Security is paramount

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit tests first** - Test individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration tests** - Test component interactions
3. **End-to-end tests** - Test complete user workflows

### Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 80% coverage for critical files
- **Minimum**: 60% coverage for all active files
- **Timeline**: Prioritize based on risk assessment

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. **Don't skip tests** - Fix the code, not the tests
2. **Don't add test-only code paths** - Test real functionality
3. **Don't test implementation details** - Test behavior and contracts

## Next Steps
1. Create test plans for each 0% coverage file
2. Write comprehensive tests for command processing
3. Improve webhook and authentication testing
4. Set up coverage monitoring in CI/CD

## Tracking Progress
Monitor coverage improvements using:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

Update this document as coverage improves and new gaps are identified.
