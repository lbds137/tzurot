## ✅ What's Complete

### Architecture
- ✅ TypeScript monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ Three microservices (api-gateway, ai-worker, bot-client)
- ✅ Clean architecture (no v2 DDD mess)

### Services Built
- ✅ **api-gateway**: HTTP API + BullMQ job queue manager
- ✅ **ai-worker**: AI processing with Gemini support
- ✅ **bot-client**: Discord.js client with webhook management

### AI Provider Support
- ✅ Gemini 2.5 Pro (using your existing API key)
- ✅ Claude 4.5 Sonnet (via OpenRouter when you add key)
- ✅ Easy to switch providers via env var

### Configuration
- ✅ `.env` file created with your credentials
- ✅ Deployment scripts ready
- ✅ Example personalities (Lilith, Default, Sarcastic)

### Documentation
- ✅ Architecture decisions documented
- ✅ v2 feature tracking
- ✅ Railway deployment guide
- ✅ Deployment scripts with README

## 🚂 Deploy to Railway (Next Steps)

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended for First Time)

```bash
cd /home/deck/WebstormProjects/tzurot/tzurot-v3

# 1. Push code to GitHub first
git push origin feat/v3-architecture-rewrite

# 2. Create Railway project and services via dashboard:
#    - Go to https://railway.app
#    - Create new project
#    - Add three services from GitHub repo:
#      * api-gateway (root: tzurot-v3/services/api-gateway)
#      * ai-worker (root: tzurot-v3/services/ai-worker)
#      * bot-client (root: tzurot-v3/services/bot-client)
#    - Add Redis service

# 3. Set environment variables via CLI
./scripts/deploy-railway-dev.sh

# 4. Services will auto-deploy from GitHub
#    Wait for api-gateway to deploy, then:
./scripts/update-gateway-url.sh https://your-gateway-url.railway.app
```

### Option 2: Full CLI Deploy

```bash
cd /home/deck/WebstormProjects/tzurot/tzurot-v3

# Link to Railway project
railway link

# Set variables
./scripts/deploy-railway-dev.sh

# Deploy each service
railway up --service api-gateway
railway up --service ai-worker
railway up --service bot-client
```

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check service health
curl https://your-gateway.railway.app/health

# View logs
railway logs --service api-gateway
railway logs --service ai-worker
railway logs --service bot-client

# Test in Discord
# Go to your Discord server and type:
#   @YourBot hello
#   @lilith tell me about yourself
```

## ⚙️ Current Configuration

**AI Provider:**
- Using: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Fallback: Can switch to OpenRouter by setting `AI_PROVIDER=openrouter`

**Personalities:**
- Lilith: Spiritual/psychological, Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- Default: Helpful assistant, Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- Sarcastic: Witty bot, Claude 4.5 Sonnet

**Features Enabled:**
- ✅ Basic message routing (@mention support)
- ✅ Webhook avatars per personality
- ✅ Message splitting (Discord 2000 char limit)
- ⏸️ Conversation history (not yet)
- ⏸️ Auto-response (not yet)
- ⏸️ Vector memory (not yet)

## 🔑 Required Services on Railway

1. **Redis** (for BullMQ job queue)
   - Add via Railway dashboard: "New" → "Database" → "Redis"
   - Automatically sets `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` for all services

2. **api-gateway** (HTTP API)
   - Enable public networking
   - Note the public URL for bot-client

3. **ai-worker** (background job processor)
   - No public networking needed
   - Connects to Redis

4. **bot-client** (Discord connection)
   - No public networking needed
   - Connects to api-gateway

## 📝 Post-Deployment TODO

After successful deployment:

1. **Test basic functionality:**
   - @mention bot in Discord
   - @mention personality (e.g., @lilith)
   - Verify webhook avatars show correctly

2. **Add OpenRouter key (optional):**
   ```bash
   railway variables set \
     AI_PROVIDER=openrouter \
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key \
     --service ai-worker
   ```

3. **Add more features incrementally:**
   - Slash commands
   - Conversation history
   - Auto-response
   - Vector memory

4. **Monitor costs:**
   - Gemini: Free tier available
   - OpenRouter: Pay per use
   - Railway: $5/month credit

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**Bot not responding:**
```bash
# Check bot-client logs
railway logs --service bot-client

# Verify GATEWAY_URL is set
railway variables --service bot-client

# Verify Discord token
railway variables --service bot-client | grep DISCORD_TOKEN
```

**AI responses failing:**
```bash
# Check ai-worker logs
railway logs --service ai-worker

# Verify Gemini key
railway variables --service ai-worker | grep GEMINI_API_KEY

# Test Gemini API directly
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_KEY
```

**Gateway errors:**
```bash
# Check api-gateway logs
railway logs --service api-gateway

# Verify Redis connection
railway variables --service api-gateway | grep REDIS
```
