## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->

Surfaced 2026-07-20 (#1732 review observation) — the `.claude/hooks/*.probe.sh` exit-code harnesses (cwd-drift, promise-ledger, develop-code-commit-guard) are "run manually after editing the hook," not wired into `pnpm quality`/CI — a future hook edit could silently regress the guard with no safety net. Applies to the pre-existing develop-code-commit-guard.probe.sh too (not new to #1732). **Fix shape**: a lightweight gate that runs every `*.probe.sh` when any `.claude/hooks/*.sh` changed (a `guard:hook-probes` ops command in the lint job, or a pre-commit keyed on the hooks-dir diff). **Promote when**: next hook-script touch, or a probe-detectable regression slips through.

**Why:** 05-tooling prefers structural enforcement over remembered manual steps; the probes exist but their execution is memory-dependent.
