# Qdrant Vector Database Scripts

**Status:** Obsolete for v3 (v3 uses pgvector)

These scripts were used in v2 when Tzurot used Qdrant as the vector database for long-term memory storage. v3 migrated to pgvector (PostgreSQL with vector extension).

## Scripts in this directory

- Memory testing and retrieval
- Collection management and debugging
- Index rebuilding and optimization
- LTM (Long-Term Memory) auditing and backfilling

**⚠️ Do not run these scripts on v3 - they reference services that no longer exist.**

Kept for historical reference and potential insights for v3 memory system improvements.
