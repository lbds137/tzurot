# V2 to V3 Migration Scripts

**Status:** One-time use (migration complete)

These scripts were used to migrate data from v2 (Shapes.inc-based) to v3 (self-hosted with OpenRouter/Gemini).

## Scripts in this directory

- **import-shapes-inc-memories.ts** - Import conversation history and memories from Shapes.inc export
- **populate-shapes-mappings.ts** - Create UUID mappings for v2 user/personality IDs

**⚠️ Do not run these scripts - migration already complete.**

Kept for reference in case data needs to be re-imported or migration logic needs to be reviewed.
