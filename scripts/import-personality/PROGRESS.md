# Import Tool Development Progress

## Session Summary - 2025-01-27

### ✅ Completed Work

#### 1. **PersonalityMapper** - Core mapping logic
- ✅ Maps shapes.inc 385-line JSON → v3 normalized schema
- ✅ Handles personality, system_prompts, llm_configs tables
- ✅ Preserves custom fields (keywords, favorite_reacts, custom messages)
- ✅ Model name handling (pass-through, shapes.inc used OpenRouter)
- ✅ Field validation (required fields, ranges, formats)
- ✅ **Tested successfully** with cold-kerach-batuach

**Key insight from testing**: Shapes.inc used OpenRouter format, so model names need no mapping!

#### 2. **AvatarDownloader** - Avatar self-hosting
- ✅ Downloads from shapes.inc URLs
- ✅ Stores in Railway volume (`/data/avatars`)
- ✅ Generates public URLs for API gateway
- ✅ Fallback to default avatar on failure
- ✅ Management methods (exists, delete, list, stats)

**Note**: No avatars in legacy backups - must download fresh during import.

#### 3. **UUIDMapper** - ID resolution
- ✅ Resolves shapes.inc user UUID → Discord ID → v3 persona UUID
- ✅ Handles orphaned users (can't resolve UUID)
- ✅ Caching for performance
- ✅ Batch resolution support
- ✅ Statistics tracking

**Strategy**: Use Discord IDs as bridge between systems.

#### 4. **MemoryImporter** - LTM import
- ✅ Maps shapes.inc memory format → v3 Qdrant metadata
- ✅ Integrates with UUIDMapper for user resolution
- ✅ Tracks orphaned memories
- ✅ Validation (duplicates, empty summaries, timestamps)
- ✅ Statistics and error tracking
- ✅ Dry run mode

**Note**: Embedding generation and Qdrant write operations deferred to main CLI tool.

#### 5. **Type Definitions** - Complete type system
- ✅ Shapes.inc format types
- ✅ V3 format types
- ✅ Import tool types (options, results, validation)
- ✅ Custom fields captured (favorite_reacts, keywords, etc.)

#### 6. **Documentation**
- ✅ README with component overview
- ✅ Testing instructions
- ✅ Usage examples (planned CLI)
- ✅ Notes on custom fields, model names, avatars

### 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Custom Fields**: Found `favorite_reacts`, `keywords`, `search_description` not in v3 schema
   - **Solution**: Store in `customFields` JSON column

2. **Model Names**: No mapping needed - shapes.inc used OpenRouter format
   - `openai/gpt-oss-120b` preserved as-is (valid model, just newer than training data)

3. **Avatars**: Not in legacy backups, must download fresh
   - Shapes.inc URLs: `https://files.shapes.inc/api/files/avatar_{uuid}.png`

4. **Orphaned Memories**: Need cleanup tool for existing Qdrant data
   - Lilith has orphaned entries in old format
   - Need standardization across all personalities

### 📦 Components Tested

- ✅ **PersonalityMapper**: Successfully maps cold-kerach-batuach config
- ✅ **Custom Fields**: Verified all fields captured correctly
- 🔲 **AvatarDownloader**: Not yet tested (no shapes.inc avatars to download)
- 🔲 **UUIDMapper**: Not yet tested (needs Prisma + test data)
- 🔲 **MemoryImporter**: Not yet tested (needs full integration)

### 🚧 Remaining Work

#### High Priority
1. **Main CLI Tool** (`import-personality.ts`)
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - File loading and validation
   - Orchestrate all components
   - Error handling and rollback
   - Progress display

2. **Qdrant Cleanup Tool** (`QdrantMigrator.ts`)
   - Find old format memories
   - Update to v3 metadata format
   - Handle orphaned entries
   - Backup before migration

#### Integration Work
3. **Database Operations**
   - Personality creation with Prisma
   - System prompt and LLM config creation
   - Link records creation
   - Orphaned persona creation

4. **Qdrant Operations**
   - OpenAI embedding generation
   - Qdrant client initialization
   - Memory storage with vectors
   - Error handling and retries

5. **Avatar Operations**
   - Integration with API gateway
   - Static file serving setup
   - Railway volume configuration

#### Testing
6. **Full Integration Test**
   - Import cold-kerach-batuach completely
   - Verify PostgreSQL records
   - Verify Qdrant memories
   - Test avatar serving
   - Validate bot can use imported personality

### 📊 Test Data Statistics

**cold-kerach-batuach**:
- Config: 30,914 bytes (385 lines)
- System prompt: 3,019 characters
- Character info: 1,469 characters
- Memories: 107 LTM summaries
- Chat history: 625 messages
- Date range: 2025-05-18 to 2025-07-22
- Unique users: 1
- Model: `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (temp: 1.5)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Build main CLI tool** - Orchestrate all components
2. **Add Qdrant cleanup** - Standardize existing Lilith memories
3. **Test with cold-kerach-batuach** - Full integration test
4. **Document lessons learned** - Update import plan with findings
5. **Import Lilith** - Real personality import

### 💡 Design Decisions

1. **Custom Fields in JSON**: Rather than add columns for shapes.inc-specific fields, store in `customFields` JSON column for flexibility.

2. **Model Name Pass-Through**: Shapes.inc used OpenRouter format, so no mapping needed. Trust the data.

3. **Avatar Download on Import**: No avatars in backups, so download fresh. Prevents stale/broken image references.

4. **Orphaned Persona Strategy**: Single dedicated persona (`00000000...`) for all orphaned memories. Allows future migration if users link accounts.

5. **Dry Run Mode**: Essential for validation before committing changes. Parse and validate without writing.

### 🐛 Issues to Watch

1. **Shapes.inc availability**: How long will shapes.inc URLs remain accessible? Download avatars ASAP.

2. **Discord ID resolution**: What % of shapes.inc users have Discord IDs? May have more orphans than expected.

3. **Memory quality**: Are shapes.inc LTM summaries good enough, or should we regenerate from chat history?

4. **Qdrant schema changes**: Existing Lilith memories may have incompatible metadata. Need migration.

### 📝 Notes for Future Sessions

- Avatar downloader needs integration test when shapes.inc still accessible
- UUIDMapper needs test with real Prisma database
- Consider batch import tool for all 68 personalities
- Document security considerations for user-facing backup command

### 🎮 Future: Slash Commands vs Scripts

**Current approach**: Scripts for testing and development
- Quick iteration
- Easy debugging
- No Discord API constraints

**Future approach**: Slash commands for production
- User-facing personality import
- Integrated with bot workflow
- Better UX for end users

**Discord limits**: 100 slash commands per bot
- Use command subgroups to organize
- Example: `/admin import personality cold-kerach-batuach`
- Example: `/admin cleanup qdrant --dry-run`
- Groups: `/admin`, `/personality`, `/memory`, `/backup`

**Migration path**:
1. ✅ Build as scripts first (current)
2. Test and validate functionality
3. Extract core logic into services
4. Create slash command handlers that use services
5. Deploy as bot commands

**Benefits of scripts-first approach**:
- Faster development cycle
- No need to redeploy bot for testing
- Can run locally without Discord connection
- Easier to test error handling
- Better logging and debugging
